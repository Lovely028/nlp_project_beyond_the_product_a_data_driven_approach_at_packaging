B0B3947PL9,"A tad bulky This is a very bulky flosser. That being said, it works very well, I started off on the 'strong' setting, and it worked well. The only two complaints I have would be that It's awkward to maneuver once you start getting towards the back of your mouth, and that the water reservoir drains very quickly. Other than that, it's not too difficult to use. The first few times you use it will probably be a little messy, so be prepared for that, but once you get the hang of it, you can move along pretty quickly and be done flossing in very little time. Overall, other than the bulkiness, I enjoyed this product!",positive,0,2022-11-13,Health & Personal Care

It’d be all set for gifting!<br /><br />The price (around $15 currently) seems quite reasonable for the three items included: scissors, comb, and brush.<br /><br />The brush had a few loose bristles but not bad. The scissors are a good size and seem plenty sharp. The beard comb is double sided and the perfect thickness for trimming.

B07PVTHHFX,"Surprisingly bad I didn't realize that dental floss could be a hard thing to produce. Well, apparently it is.<br /><br />1. The way this stuff is wrapped makes it impossible to pull out of the container without unscrewing the cap and taking the ""ball"" of floss out.<br /><br />2. If you do manage to pull some out through the cap, the hole in the cap will cut the floss instead of the part that should cut the floss.<br /><br />3. This floss is thick and ends up breaking frequently in my teeth. I end up using 2-3x as much as I would with normal floss.<br /><br />4. Taste. Meh. No real taste.<br /><br />5. So here's the thing, once you get past all those issues, the floss manages to get the gunk out from between my teeth but there's no way it's worth 2-4x what normal floss is. And, while this stuff is good for the fishies and dolphins and iguanas I'm not sure that having to buy it 2-3x more often is better for mama earth.",negative,1,2021-06-26,Health & Personal Care
B088MFJ32P,"Fouth favorite case I've tried for the t:slim X2. I've tried four different cases for the t:slim X2.<br /><br />The t-case that came with the pump was mediocre  The clip didn't reliably hold it on my web belts whether used in the vertical or horizontal orientation. When I tried sleeping with the pump at night in a t-shirt pocket the clip dug into me.  The t:case is very strong, hard and unyielding. It's my second choice.<br /><br /> Note: All these followig cases, whether branded in the molds or not, are manufacted by other companies, mostly in China, and sold under many names. The US sellers are distributors and dealers.<br /><br />The next case I tried was this one.  It had no clip.  It had to be removed to change cartridges; the opening for the cartridge was too small and there was no slot to insert the removal card into to pry the cartridge loose.  It's not difficult to do but that reoeated stress 122x/year imo will impact its life.<br /><br />This case is okay if you are willing to carry it in a pocket, remove it every 2-3 days for a cartridge change and attach a suitable clip to it. That was too many compomises for me.  So this is my fourth choice.<br /><br />I contacted the seller who told me it was an older model.  I couldn't exchange it for the new model; they didnt list in the color I wanted in their Amazon listing.  So I returned it.  The newer model is currently sold by another seller as item B09KCRNCY3.  This one doesn't protect the pump a well as the t:case does  without its beltclip. It's better than the t:case bare, but since a clip costs  $5-8 and installation, not as good as the OEM.  So it's my third choice.<br /><br />My current first choice is almost the same as my third choice but covers much more of the face.  It's being sold now as B09L2CY5Q3.  I attached a clip to it and have worn it for 4 months, day and night.  It is simillar to the Medmax case B09PN979K4, but lighter, without the corner bumpers.<br /><br />If the case I'm using doesn't outlive my pump, and i can't get the same one again, the Medmax would be my next chiose.",negative,0,2022-10-29,

I like the fact that it is mobile; you can strap it on and are not restricted to an horizontal position. However, if you don't want to chock to death, you will need to keep your hands in the handles.If you are looking for real heat, this is not your massager.

I have purchased various similar products but none quite measured up. MacKENZIES uses eucalyptus along with ammonia which makes it unique. Not to mention how perfect the bottle is.  I just happened to take a flyer and search for it and lo and behold Dylans Pharmacy in the UK had a new listing. I ordered 3 bottles which arrived in 9 days and they are indeed the real deal. The packaging shows Teva as the manufacturer with a manufacture date of 12/2018 and an expiration of 12/2021. (See the pics). Teva acquired the previous maker Actavis back in 2015 which most likely explains the absence from the marketplace for the last few years. Expect more listings since production has resumed.

This all-natural corn starch dental floss product comes in 2 compact rectangular-sized boxes.<br /><br />Each box measures 2-3/8 inches tall (not including the lid, which I removed) x 1-inch width x 1-inch depth.<br />I like taking this dental floss with me when commuting; this box does not take up much space in the center console of my car.<br /><br />Each box contains 50 meters of dental floss. The floss is unraveled from the top.<br /><br />I find this floss is not as sturdy as my usual brand. If I used the same area of floss to go through 2-3 teeth, the floss will break.

Regarding the scent, it is refreshing and a pleasant lime smell. I would have given this 5 stars if it wouldn't have leaked.",neutral,1,2020-07-25,

B000POJL9M,Then the item works great and won't break I have one of these from a different company (essentially an identical thing). When I first started using it I noticed that trying to stretch jeans more than one inch would make the tube running between the front and the back flex and bow. I could get about an inch and three quarters before it was ready to break. because of the bow you aren't getting full stretch effect.<br />That's because the center tube is made of hollow plastic. What I had to do to give it enough rigidity was to drill out the hole in the center of the tube segments with a 3/8 inch drill bit and then cut a piece from 3/8 inch aluminum solid round bar stock (you can get them at a hardware store for a few $$) long enough to fit the entire length of the center part.<br />That stops the flexing and bowing. Then the item works great and won't break. I also use a plant sprayer bottle with water to wet the waistband (I wet both inside and outside to get the waistband soaked) and I leave the pants on the stretcher overnight to allow the waist band to dry.,neutral,1,2017-07-26,Health & Personal Care

I don't enjoy the incredible painful prickly side of the bottle. Whose idea was that, and why? I have to wrap the bottle in a fabric or a towel because there's no way you want that touching your body. It's like leaning into a cactus.<br />What I do like about this bottle is that it stays warm all night as long as you keep it under blankets.<br />It never leaks, the rubber is durable and thick, and if you have cats, you don't have to worry about them puncturing it.<br />The bad news is that this morning, out of the blue, it decided to spring a leak all over my bed. It appears that one of the seams simply gave out. I guess I got a lot of use out of it in these 4 years, but I'm not too happy about my soaked mattress.

B003UPOK58,"One of the better protein options for the money This protein from EAS can be significantly less expensive per pound than what you'd pay for some of the premium stuff at GNC (if you catch a good sale at Amazon or if you have a membership to Costco/Sams). Some of the reviews focus on the fact that 23g of Protein in 2 scoops is a little skimpy. While this may be true, I'm not sure you'd want/need much more than 23g in one serving and if they used any less than 2 scoops for that same amount of protein you'd definitely sacrifice some of the taste. I've found that this EAS Protein tastes better than most other protein powders out there. The chocolate blends very well with skim milk and I usually throw a banana into the blender as well and it comes out great everytime. I strongly suggest using a blender as shaking by hand or stirring with a spoon will leave large sticky clumps in the glass and eventually in your mouth.<br /><br />You may be able to find better products out there, but the price is reasonable and the taste is definitely above average.",positive,0,2011-03-26,Health & Personal Care

B07TYZ2S1K,"Exceptional travel flosser! I think I can speak for most people when I say, ""I hate flossing!""  I find it a hassle to measure out the string and then stand in front of the mirror, pulling the floss through each row of teeth<br /><br />I did find a way of dealing with the task.  I bought an electric Waterpik flosser.  I must say, that flosser has entirely improved my oral cleaning habits.  It's like a power wash for your teeth and it does an excellent job of loosening food stuck in-between teeth.<br /><br />As I travel often, I don't have the luxury of taking such a large home flosser unit with me.  My morning routine in my hotel room consists of standing in the mirror with floss in hand.  When I am away from home, I absolutely miss my Waterpik.<br /><br />I actually came upon this portable flosser by accident and it took me by surprise.  I never knew these things existed or even COULD exist.  If you have ever used a home water flosser, you know that they are very powerful and push a hard stream of water against your teeth.  I never imagined that could actually be replicated in a wireless product.<br /><br />In fact, when I ordered this portable water flosser, I didn't actually think it would work.  However, at best, this would be an interesting experiment for me and if I was dissatisfied with the way it performed, I would ship it back to Amazon.<br /><br />The flossing unit is rather large.  It's bigger than holding a full tube of toothpaste in the hand.  It also has a bit of weight to it.  Of course, something like this would need a heavier motor and it would have to be large enough to hold a considerable amount of water.<br /><br />It came out of the box partially charged so I was able to test it immediately.  This flosser included a USB charging cable but you will need to supply your own USB charging brick.  You can use one of the small 5 volt adapters that come with most mobile phones.  I used one of my iPhone charging bricks.<br /><br />The flosser also comes with 4 flossing tips designed for different types of floss applications.  Honestly, I don't know much about what tip does what, but I immediately went for the standard tip as that is what I use in my Waterpik home flosser.<br /><br />This brings me to a concerning point:  I am not certain where I can buy replacement tips or if they are standardized across the board.  For instance, I found that Waterpik tips do not fit in this flosser.  I am hoping the industry has set some sort of standard for the size of these tips so that they can easily be replaced.  The good news is, these tips do last a long time before having to be replaced.<br /><br />When inserting one of the tips into this flosser you simply need to insert and then twist the tip to lock.  The included instructions do a great job of illustrating the process.  The next step is to fill the reservoir with water, secure and turn it on.<br /><br />Here is the point where I became very impressed...<br /><br />This is very powerful for a portable flosser.  The stream of water that ejected from the tip was forceful enough that it removed slivers of food I had stuck in my teeth from dinner.  I mean, I look down in the sink and there they were!  I did have to refill the reservoir more than once to do a complete job, but I knew this would not handle nearly as much fluid as my home unit.<br /><br />There are different modes of strength that include Normal, Soft and Pulse.  I always enjoy the pulsating action as it feels good against my teeth.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you are thinking of a powerful home flosser, I would first recommend a Waterpik as they are more powerful and hold more water,  However, that's not taking any merits away from the Misiki flosser.  It's more than half the cost, is nearly as powerful, and boasts something that the Waterpik home units can't:  the ability to be portable.<br /><br />I can now take a powerful flosser with me on vacation.  At last, I can ditch the string and enjoy the same flossing benefits on the road that I do at home.  I am really impressed with how powerful this thing is.

B004L33SJW,"Best Model Tested Thus Far As someone who has purchased five other bottles for comparison purposes, I can say that I prefer this bottle to the others for a couple of reasons.  First, the part that screws onto the bottle is better made so that the bottle does not leak.  Lest this sound simplistic, the problems experienced with other bottles is that the moment the bottle is tipped over, it begins to leak.  The amount of leakage increases as one squeezes.  However, the rigidity of the screw top of this unit is such that leakage has not occurred.<br /><br />Secondly, the spray is a bit more subtle.  Some bottles have a single outlet for the water so there is one stream.  This is sometimes desirable but not always.  The Leka Travel Bidet has several smaller holes which allows for wider distribution of the water and probably an overall cleaner experience.<br /><br />Since I am the first to review this particular model, I will repeat what I have written elsewhere about portable bidets.  The word &#34;portable&#34; suggests the bidets are mainly useful when traveling, especially perhaps to countries that either do not routinely supply toilet tissue or where the tissue might not seem hygienic.  However, it goes without saying that anyone who is sensitive to chemicals in the paper would probably like to consider such a bottle as an alternative to paper.  Likewise, if one is concerned about the environment or using a composting toilet, these bottles have a real niche.  They are also useful for people with motion issues, such as those recovering from surgery or whose infirmities or lack of agility interfere with good hygiene.<br /><br />There are additional reasons to use such bottles.  One can bring one's own water and perhaps reduce the risks associated with potentially contaminated water.  It is also possible to medicate the water with essential oils or herbs to reduce risks of various types of microbial and fungal infections.  As someone who travels a lot, I find these bottles very useful and I like the fact that this one has a cap for the nozzle.  It seems like an extra touch to prevent both leakage and contamination.  However, unlike the other models I have bought, this one does not have a carrying bag.  Having never used the bags supplied, I do not regard this is a shortcoming.<br /><br />For those who are concerned about where things are made, it would seem this is made in China.  The print on the box is mostly in Chinese, but the suggestions for use include various medical conditions such as hemorrhoids and itchiness.  The advice is aimed at ladies, but there is no reason that gents would not also find this very useful.<br /><br />Update after long use:<br /><br />A few ago, the little blue tip to the nozzle fell off.  There are no threads and no sign of glue.  It might therefore have simply been pushed into place.  I cannot get it to stay in place.  The bottle will still work but without as much control over the water flow and without the ability to direct the water.  I think this is a design flaw and could easily be corrected with threads.  In the meantime, I will try glue.",positive,1,2016-12-23,Health & Personal Care

Vibrations are not the tinniest, but they aren't particularly powerful either.

However it will get on your lens and it's an annoyance to remove without something to actually scrub it off a little. Still not too bad more pros then cons, it melts really quickly if your face is greasy. However what really got me is how hard it is, I even sent them a message checking if the application was normal. It wouldn't come off the tube easily I had to cut chunks off to rub them into my glasses' nose pads. So After that and being so hard to push out out, it just broke the chapstick tube. It's s hard that you can't even push it out and broke the tube it popped out the bottom. I really like the product itself I think it works well but not in this applicator.

I have been wearing the soft foam plugs, but when I saw these, I was eager to give them a try.  They looked perfect!<br />However, I was disappointed at their sound blocking abilities. The foam plugs do a much better job of blocking noise.  Even with these earplugs in, I still had to plug my ears with my fingers to block out loud sounds.<br /><br />Though they don’t do a good job of blocking sound, they are fairly comfortable and they stay in my ears much better than the foam plugs.  They’re also waterproof and come in a handy carrying case (though they get stuck in the case, making it hard to open or close).<br /><br />However, my main reason for wearing earplugs all the time is to block sound, and these fail at that, so I can’t give them more than three stars. It seems like I just cannot get a good seal with them  inside my ear canal.  If I could, perhaps they’d do a better job of blocking sound.<br />Also, they’re very OBVIOUS.

This band is not made of the same stuff the actual fitbit bands are made of.  This band is harder - not quite as flexible I guess - and the edges get dirty quickly.  It doesn't wipe off or come clean well.  The fitbit itself fits nicely inside and the clasps work very well.  The colors are awesome and different than those that fitbit sells.

I had mine professionally tested and it is 21%. The scale will measure me anywhere from 36%-39%.

B01LVUZOLR,"NEED ANOTHER PERSON TO APPLY CUPS Inside the box there is an instruction book(English). I did not read the instruction book, but did my own internet research on where to put the cups to treat different problems. I heard from a friend who grow up with cupping therapy suggest put the cups (the big ones) on the back is the safest place, and put them on the place where there are &quot;&quot;meat&quot;&quot;, not bones. I did this for my son (9 year old) who has asthma to clear up debris on the back by putting 6 cups (3 each side) near chest area.<br /><br />The suction guns are powerful, and just two pumps I see the skin raised almost to the silver point inside the cup. Two pumps are usually enough to get results. I used this for my son who got sick often and even after getting well he would continue to have dry cough that usually drag for weeks. I used the cups 10 min each time before bed time on the back when he was at the dry cough stage. I did my own research what meridian points on the back I should place the cups. The first time I did this I saw good results. He started to cough out phlem instead of dry cough, and after one week he totally stopped coughing and there was no more restriction in breathing. You may see the skin turned red or purple (like a pepperoni) and I read that was normal. That color change was due to &quot;&quot;debris&quot;&quot; and the cups cleaned them out. From my experience, the peppeoni went away in a few days. I used the cups for 7 days and my son's cough was less and less. After 10 days I no longer need the cups. I am sure I will use it again next time he get sick.<br /><br />The cups does not suck well on elbow joints, knee joints, legs, or ankles. And I do not find much use of the small size cups yet. I read that they are for face, or for babies, and I have been using the big and medium size cups. So far I only use them on the back and only need 5-6 cups, and got good results, and I am happy with them. Also after applying the cup, don't move, or they will fall out. My experience is that you definite need a second person to hold the cup and angle the gun right on top of the cup to suck. After you remove the cup, the skin may feel itchy so have some cream, lotion, or massage oil ready to rub a little bit to make you feel more comfortable.<br /><br />I dropped the cups a few times on hardwood floor from about 2-3 feet high and luckily they did not break. But it is hard plastic so there is a chance it will break if you drop it on very hard surfaces.",positive,1,2017-01-23,Health & Personal Care

B01CVF4DPE,"50 Shades of........ Wow! First time I have owned a 10 speed vibration penis ring! It is the second toy that I have purchased for the bedroom. Both my husband and myself enjoy this item immensely. The penis ring has a silicone cover, so you want to make sure when you use it, that you have it properly covering the base which is the vibration piece. You slip the ring over the penis down to the base and turn it on. The various speeds will bring you  and your partner the most extreme pleasure. The bumps are for the woman to enjoy while the vibration is assisting in the pleasure department for the male. The flexibility of the silicone will allow it to fit any size penis. It is easy to keep clean, you will simply slip the silicone off the base of the vibration piece and rinse with soap and water. You can dry off with a soft cloth or let it air dry. For storage and discretion, you can put it back into the pouch and into a drawer. The item can be playful as well as being out of sight and mind from anyone else.  Anybody who wants a little more spice in the bedroom, this would make a great addition to your intimate toy collection. You can't go wrong with the color pink either! I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest & unbiased review and that is exactly what I have given.

B008OPK8EQ,"Long review- giving it a second try I purchased the 3 bottle set( 90 days). Im one bottle in and things are going ok. I take 4 daily with no stomach irritation or other problems. The pills dont taste that good and start dissolving upon contact with water. I take them with lots of water. So far my shedding as increased and is causing me concern. I haven't seen a change in the condition of my hair or balding areas yet and no uptake in growth rate either.<br /><br />Of note, I was already taking most of the ingredients listed as contained in Toji in other supplements. So I expected this to kick in quicker since I have the vitamins, herbs and minerals already in my system for the last several (6-8) months. That hasn't happened but I'm  Still hopeful , I will update in another 30 days.<br /><br />Updated_ July 27<br /><br />Two days away from concluding my second bottle and so far....I have no increase in my hair growth ( i only get 1/8&#34; a month) , no increase in shine ( my hair's still frizzy and unruly) or thickness either( still thinning with bald spots).  I have increased shedding and breakage since I started to take these, which is upsetting to me.  My fingernails do seems to grow fast but that is all that I have noticed.  I am not happy with my experience  taking these so far.<br /><br />Update August 28- added stars to my rating.<br /><br />Beginning my fourth bottle and I'm finally noticing a betterment in my hair. It still grows slowly but I have noticeably growing hair at my edges. Shedding and breakage has decreased and my hair seems a  little thicker. . It looks much better than it did three months<br />ago or even one month ago.<br /><br />Update at 4 months: September 25<br /><br />Still no faster growth and only minor thickening. I've reduced my dosage to half... One in the morning and one in evening and so far no change in the condition of my hair.From my last update. i think ive gotten all I'll  get from these. I plan to continue two a day for the time  being until I can find something else.<br /><br />Final review october 2013<br /><br />I no longer take these. I saw only minor improvement in the condition of my hair after almost 5 months at high dosage, which was four a day. My fingernails grew pretty fast but that's it.  I saw no regrowth in bald/thinning areas and no change in growth rate either.  I've stopped taking them and so far, nothing happened. No shedding or breaking etc. Seemed they weren't that effective for me. Very pricey fail.<br /><br />February 2014 second try<br /><br />I'm desperate to stop my hair loss so I'm giving these another try. It seems they were effective in slowing my loss and some increase in thickness. Since I stopped taking them it seems my hair went back to very thin.  It took about three months to show. So if this worked and I didn't notice it's worth a second try. I need it bad because nothing else is working. I started two a day for one month January and now back up to 4 for the next three.

I find that if I don't want odor or smoke, I need to insert the device and create the seal on the outside. This feels and looks quite strange as the opening is fairly large. The only thing I would suggest about this product is to have and optional attachment where the mouthpiece taper more like a funnel for those who do no care about its portability factor. Example being right now I only use in my house, so the extra few inches it might add to the device would not be an issue. It's possible that tapering too much would restrict enough air flow to make it easy to blow through , but something a tad bit smaller on the mouthpiece end would  be nice as an optional attachment.<br /><br />Thanks Smoke Buddy!",positive,1,2016-12-07,

Threading the eye of a needle is getting more and more difficult.. These sound like a great idea, and they are, except the needle is made from very cheap material, not carbon steel like most sewing needles.. They thread easy enough, but you can't sew with them because whatever they're made from is so thick and course it won't slide through fabric easily. It snags the fabric terribly.. They aren't even shiny like a normal needle.. Huge waste of money. Over priced to say the least..<br />I suspect the 5 star rating given by a man who purchased them for his wife may have been told they worked great by his wife in order to spare his feelings.. I truly don't know how anyone could sew anything with these!",negative,0,2013-05-23,Health & Personal Care
B01LXD1B7C,"Not meant for all types of canes. The product description makes it look like it will fit any cane.  Not the case - it's a replacement tip for canes that already have this type of &#34;hook style&#34; tip on it.  I was able to &#34;take apart&#34; my wife's cane and make it work.  Her cane had an extra loop of elastic at the handle end (she uses it to hang her can or loop around her wrist), so I removed the cap on the handle, untied the knot and slipped it through the cap. I attached a long piece of sturdy wire to this end of the elastic and let it slide down the cane - this allowed the elastic to freely fall to the end of the cane where I looped the elastic that came with the roller tip onto the cane elastic - then hooked it onto the roller-tip.  pushed the roller tip into place - pulled the wire and elastic back through the handle end.  The challenging part was getting it back into the handle cap hole. I hade to use a screwdriver (or a ruler will work) to hold the second loop of elastic on top of the handle .  I pulled the elastic up through the handle and where the loop for the handle and the loop for the first section connected - I put the screwdriver through it and let it sit on tip of the handle (it will make a t-shape). I ended up using electrical tape to tape the top loop together so it was smaller and stiff to fit through the hole.  Once that was through - I pulled up on it until everything was tight - released the screwdriver - do not let go of that loop you put through the cap  - I then put a knot in place like it was before I disassembled. Replaced the cap and folded and unfolded the cane to ensure everything worked - had my wife try it to make sure the roller tip didn't flop off.  All checked out and the wife is happy!

B0B8TFV2SR,Feeling much better and helping fix other issues!!!! These past three years after meals I have been feeling more bloated and having more stomach issues then I ever had before. I tried taking fibers and probiotics but felt those were only sending me to the toilet more frequently and never fixing my issues. I did some research and ran across Immunoglobulins and the one in Vital Gut Repair+ was even LACTOSE FREE! The more I researched the quicker realized this ingredient was previously by prescription for people with leaky gut!!! Been on the program of one scoop a day every day and I can truly feel something working in my body. It either goes in my water or smoothies I make and is flavorless! At the beginning I felt full which was a good sign something was working. After 5-6 days of continuous use my symptoms were gone!

Where the item quality is Medium, the customer service is Very Good.<br /><br />I put this robin's egg colored band in to service on 2/19/14. The material the replacement bands are made of is ok, but this blue one takes on dirt. As such, it did not stay as bright, and vibrant, as it is when new. It's pretty off-putting to wear a dingy accessory.<br /><br />It is now 4/21/14 and it has broken beyond being able to use.

It seems to be relatively accurate when comparing known weights and has a sturdy aluminum case.  The display digits are large and are lit when a weight is applied (see other display comments below).<br />Cons: The unit has a very narrow field of view when reading the display.  The display must be at inline eye level to be read it reliably.  Also, this unit is NOT something that you can just throw in a tool box and have it not get damaged.  As I mentioned in &#34;Pros&#34;, the case is aluminum but the actual display is covered by a thin piece of stick-on Mylar type plastic which is very susceptible to damage if you are not careful.  Ideally, the case should have been designed with a metal flap to protect the display and would have gotten it a 5-star rating in my opinion.  The designer did put the batteries (2 AAA's) under a screw down metal cover which for the most part is good except that you never want to store any device with the batteries left in it as leaking batteries can render your device worthless and voids any manufactures warranty.",neutral,1,2018-03-03,

It's simple science really, there are just times when it's biologically more convenient for us to wake up (usually every 30 minutes). I set my SleepTime app's alarm to go off when it senses I'm in a lighter sleeping phase, and I wake up to a bright room. Perfect because at 7 AM these days, it's still dark.<br />Waking up easy just makes the entire day go by a little easier.<br /><br />It can also function twofold as a light for applying makeup, because of the brightness of the light and its similarity to daylight.

This review is about this bottle specifically.<br /><br />Biggest issue, is that the shape of the bottle at the top makes it impossible to finish your drink.  The 90-degree angle that joins the bottle to the lip always will hold and retain some beverage.  Once your liquid does make it over this ill-conceived geometric obstacle, the opening is wide and uncomfortable.<br /><br />The bottle itself is of good, strong, durable plastic.  I actually wish more reusable plastic bottles were made with this material integrity.  Can't say so much for the black cap.

After wearing one of the masks for several hours (3rd mask is an example - as you can see, it stretched some after wearing), I washed it and dried it in the dryer (2nd mask). I wouldn't advise this. It shrank a lot. I put it on and it strained to fit my face, pulled on my ears. It will probably stretch out more if I wear it a bit but it's just much easier to air dry them in the future. These are inexpensive and comfortable and I would buy them again.",positive,0,2020-10-15,Health & Personal Care
B00YJZ5J12,"A MUST HAVE ***I have only used the Insulator Wax***<br /><br />Great product!<br /><br />As many other reviews have stated, you need to warm up the product before use as it is very thick straight out of the bottle.  Fill a bucket or deep bowl with hot water and let it sit for a while and you will be good to go.<br />Once warmed, a little goes a long way.  Couple of drops on your favorite applicator and you are good to go.  Very easy to apply and work with.

It's a very simple book with a cute yet classy design and includes good prompts to record your little guy's babyhood.  I'm not a scrapbooker and don't have the know-how/time to put together a completely personalized book but this one was really cute with the letter on the cover to individualize the child's name.  Also, I really hate how some books are either WAY too general so you don't get very much detail on the kid, or WAY too specific about the parents or religious ceremonies, etc.  (i.e., I DON'T have a doctorate degree and don't want pages that deal with each parents' career highlights and advanced degrees.  Yes, I've seen books like that at Target and Walmart, where I don't think those types of people would shop anyway because those books weren't great quality either.)  This book had several pages that you could do whatever you wanted with.  Like a page for a ""Special Day"" instead of a specific type of religious ceremony, then you can use it for a ceremony OR whatever else you want.  There are cute pockets for saving hair, etc. and a few extra page protectors if you want to add documents.  And of course, it has plenty of pages with the classic questions that apply to every baby and that every parent wants to remember :)<br /><br />And best of all, it's easy to fill out!  I kept an extra fine point sharpie marker in the box for the first year of my son's life and my husband and I took just a few minutes once every few months to update it and that's all it took!

The mist is very cool and so fine that it moisturizes your skin without getting it damp. It's absolutely perfect for prepping skin for creams and serums, setting makeup, cooling down from the heat, or just relaxing facial muscles.<br /><br />I like to use it after micro-needling to sooth any redness away. Refilling isn't a repetitive need, nor is charging. I've been using it daily for about a week on the charge it came in the box already having. There's a very small vibrating noise, but it's nothing irritating.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that they claim it's nourishing on the box, and water cannot nourish. It can help moisturize and plump up your skin, but there are no vitamins to feed it. This is not a replacement for creams and serums. It's a compliment to them, like gua sha.<br /><br />I have experimented with adding essential oils etc. to the water. A drop of essential oil and or a few drops of lemon juice can be added without negatively impacting its function. It's also vastly superior at setting makeup.

However, I would recommend to anyone that wants to try either - download a REM tracking app for your phone.  These programs are about a dollar and can give rough estimates on when you are in REM.  Then you can try to set the mask accordingly - setting the delay correct.  This mask does not need interval programing because it tracks you REM, but it does need delay and you need to adjust the sensitivity and brightness.  I got it to work once, but not since.

The reason for a 3 star rating is the thermostat is quirky, it does not fit in a standard electrical box so it took some figuring out and modification of a decora plate to finally make it look halfway decent.  My contractor said it took him over an hour just to figure it out, and he has installed hundred of Laticrete floor warming systems, but at 4 times the cost this was a bargain, because of medications that need to be made to make it look halfway decent I was disappointed.  Since this product is designed for North American power, design the thermostat to fix standard north american electrical boxes, basic code (and common sense) says a high voltage connection needs to be in a code approved box, why not make an adaptor to fix standard north American boxes or redesign the thermostat overall.  But it does a great job warming the floor and since it is just in the bathroom, it doesn't drive the electric bill sky high.",neutral,1,2013-12-11,Health & Personal Care

I really didn't expect it to ""heal"" me instantly & I probably should have thought it out better before buying it the first time because I knew I couldn't keep up the long-term costs of buying this repeatedly. I've settled for keeping up the recurring costs associated with purchasing Flor Essence (also sold here on Amazon) because it has a good track record of aiding those with leukemia (although it has yet to do anything for me) and because it is affordable enough to maintain the treatment. (I bought only one bottle of the product to use for storage and then buy the cheaper dry tea packs for brewing. Since it is recommended that the product be stored in a dark bottle, the first bottle seemed like a good investment.)<br /><br />I sort of wish I knew someone associated with the production of the NingXia beverage that could provide it to me free, but then wishes are just like dreams.

B093DWSWSV,"Cherry Lime is a better flavor : Pricey Water About the Product: Love the square shape of the bottle, the label design and the ingredients in it.<br /><br />About the Taste : ""Defend""  Cherry Lime flavor for Toxin Defense.  This one is better tasting than watermelon, still mild in flavor but drinkable.  No sugar is good, sweetened by Stevia leaf extract.<br /><br />My take:<br />1) If the company or anyone can prove the claim about the drinks with good scientific research then I would understand.  Also even if you can prove the claim how many bottles do we have to drink to see a tiny bit of difference.  This is very expensive Infused Water in a fancy bottle.<br />2) I understand that most of these kind of products have big claims and we all at one point go with our instincts, a little bit of blind faith and/or reviews but after going through what I would like to see is does it taste good?  and is it economical?  For these reasons,  I would like to pass on this one.<br />3) These and the other big brands like VM, G, P etc they do work in the sense that they do hydrate our body, they have either some electrolytes and/or some sugar or a lot of sugar.  Ideally, this formula will give you some energy so they work.  But for certain claims, I am not very comfortable.<br /><br />I rather make my infused drinks at home.<br /><br />Tip:  1) Take a big Thermo Flask, put some ice in it, squeeze 1 lemon,  squeeze some mint juice and put the leaves in it, shred some fresh ginger, pinch of turmeric, black pepper, cinnamon, and some honey.  Shake it and drink it all day.  (Keep adding, subtracting or changing the ingredients, there are no rules)<br />  2) Before every sip, take deep breaths, 3 times.  This will change you life.

B001Z1WT70,"Took for SVT A little health history: I have problems with low blood pressure and after having my son 18 yrs ago I noticed a problem with my heart. I was diagnosed with SVT (which they said it appears I had all my life and just didn't notice until pregnancy made me more aware of my body), and I was given atenolol. Well that didn't do anything. I was also advised to have a cryoablation of my heart since I was at risk of having a sudden &quot;dry pump&quot; heart attack. Scary, and hell no. (Today, that procedure has been altered from what they wanted to do to me 18 years ago.)<br />I did some research instead and came across Horse chestnut and hawthorn. I took a bottle of Hawthorn over the course of a month, then ran out and stopped taking it. (busy working Mom not taking care of myself first) The effects lasted for months, so I thought it cured the problem. No such luck. I went to find the same Hawthorn, only could find a complex (Hawthorn/Horse chestnut/ and buthchers broom). Tried that and it wasn't as good for me; I think because there wasn't enough Hawthorn in it for me.<br />Anyways... over the years I have taken several brands because I stop and start and the Health/Herbal store changed what it carried. This brand is very effective. For me that means it works within a few hours of taking it. If the palpatations stop within 6 six hours I am happy with the brand. I usually only take one a day, unless I feel like I am going to have a heart attack/pass out. Over the years the cost has really come down do to competition. My first bottle was $28 18 years ago. So I encourage anyone to take the gamble at this price. Oh ya, and EKG's don't lie: it is effective.

B00TY29HHM,"Absolutely Excellent (see Update***) Update Below ***<br /><br />Everything about this purchase has been excellent. Yes, I did my research - endless research - before purchasing and this company and product stands up to any rigorous investigating you might want to do.  Andres, as another review stated is awesomely helpful without making you feel like an idiot when you have a question. Not that you will have questions because you take this out of the box and go through the directions once and in half an hour you have silver hydrosol ready. If you're vacillating amongst the endless rhetoric about colloid vs. hydrosol vs. God reached down and touched it, and you want to improve your health.....stop wasting time, I've purchased enough expensive silver products to know the desired effect and this is a solid and safe effect. Ionexx is shipping one to my best friend in Austria as we speak. We met in Chicago this past weekend and, knowing she wasn't feeling well, I wanted to bring her some silver, well flying and liquids 'no bueno'. Then I realized I could take the whole unit! In my pocketbook! Try packing up your beaker, hot plate, 17 batteries and what surely looks like a bomb apparatus to go help your best friend. You're about to know TSA really well. I'm so very happy with this purchase, seller and the product.<br /><br />Update: I have been just as happy with my unit. I just wanted to clarify a few things. First, make no mistake, this unit is quite powerful and will make a high ppm. I suspect both reviews talking about dark color didn't follow directions for 10 ppm. That's on them.  As to the review talking about Home Depot, the super expensive unit he claims to have gone and bought has alligator clips with rubber guards on them?? The ionexx does look possibly hand made and, last time I checked, that was a good thing. It doesn't leak, it has an overfill port. Now, I watched the video for the other unit and I'm sure it's fine, but this is my point: If at 9 p.m., when you realize you or your child has a scratchy throat, you want to head out to the garage\shop like the guy in the video and fire up your half gallon beaker and, according to their own reviews, wait a few hours, then fish out the little magnetic piece (I don't know how, it's on the bottom of the beaker) and bring your beaker to your stove and then heat it and then wait for it to cool, you go girl! But if you want to pour some water and plug in something smaller than a Bluetooth speaker, having it right on your night table and take care of your child for 15 minutes, at which time you have your fresh silver... Well, you get my point. Lastly, every time we pull out the jar, we hold it up to light and it has the most beautiful quality. Almost a luminescence from the tiny bubbles of dispersment. It's very pleasing.",positive,1,2016-12-12,Health & Personal Care

B0745YCT64,"It has issues..... The chair is better quality than most because of the cross leg construction. The problem with this chair is that, while the legs don't collapse, the seams on the seat begin to split after a short period of use. The chair is listed for a 500 pound weight limit, but I have somebody who is at 270 using this chair and the seams of the seat split. The company did send us a replacement chair, but after a week of use the seat is experiencing the same splitting. The splits don't make the chair unusable, but if somebody who may be larger then we are is using it, I would imagine it would begin to pinch the skin on the back of their legs and the split seams would eventually turn into cracks.

B000F3ZJ0I,"It does work but don't believe the hype I've successfully recharged about 80% of my alkalines, including ones that dipped below 1.0V.  The weakest battery that I was able to recharge had a baseline of 0.86V.  All got ""renewed"" to about 1.5V or a little more.  The other 20% refused to work.  The only leakages I've experienced came from Rayovac AAA's, even though they had never been charged before.  I have never charged any battery more than twice so I can't say if I can go beyond 5-10x, much less 100x.  But the ""renewed"" batteries did perform like new alkalines.<br /><br />As for NiMH's, it does charge them but I wouldn't recommend using this charger for them since it only automatically shuts down for alkalines.<br /><br />It's hard to compare this to other alkaline chargers because it seems to use a different method.  Most other alkaline chargers finish in about 16-18 hrs but this takes about 3 days.  And while others recommend charging way before the battery is depleted (> 1.0V), this one doesn't.  You can still charge if the battery is on its last breath.<br /><br />So while I agree that the hype is misleading, it does work -- at least to the extent that I've tested it.

I received the ChapStick dual-ended Hydration Lock Day & Night for free, and I will be honest, I liked the hydration and softness of the &#34;night&#34;, but didn't love the &#34;day&#34;. It was waxy and didn't go on smoothly.<br />I was glad when I got the opportunity to try the ChapStick dual-ended Hydration Lock Moisturize and Renew in my BB5 beauty box. I liked that one a whole lot better! I have been a smoker for years, and am noticing the inevitable fine lines around my lips. I can truly see and feel a difference. I use the moisturize side, when my lips are particularly dry, and use the renew side, after I put moisturizer on my face, before putting on my lip stain (I don't like messy lipstick). My lips really do look and feel younger. There are a few things I don't love about both of these, but they may not be a problem for most. They take some getting used too, since you normally, reach to the bottom of the tube, to turn up the stick, because they are dual sided, if you do this out of habit, you will turn the one on the bottom, up into the cap and ruin it, like I did with my first one lol. By the time I tried the second one, I learned my lesson, and didn't have this problem any more.

The mediums I used about a week and they fall down I have to keep pulling them up.

B093XKHLV1,"Protein ""milkshake""...........Made a mistake and thought I'd try something different I buy tubs of protein pretty much on a bi-weekly basis, so was getting tired of teh same old flavors. Saw the new flavors, chocolate hazelnut flavor oatmeal cookie, and even though they were Plant Based Proteins powder I figured what the hell - and gave them a shot. While teh flavors are good, the powders themselves are just two much. I'm used to just putting two scoops of protein powder in a 12oz smart shaker, adding some water and taking it on the go.<br /><br />This doesn't work for these proteins; two scoops and 8-12 oz of water and you get a clump of powder. I've needed to use at least 3x the amount of water to even get it to a form that's drinkable, and even then it's like drinking pancake batter. I can't even imagine using milk or almond milk.<br /><br />Granted it is smooth, but there's just way too much to drink. It's similar when you order a milkshake from silver diner, and they bring you the ""leftover"" shake in another cup, which is basically the equivalent of having to drink two shakes.<br /><br />Probably turned me off to all plant based proteins in the future. Guess it's back to my go to Fudge Brownie flavor.....",neutral,0,2021-11-19,

So...<br />The other complaint was that it did not start at 0 but 1 3/4 inches (if I remember correctly) which makes sense since it's supposed to be used clipped in.  However, it did restrict its measuring capability to circumferences only unless one wants to do the math to figure out how to measure straight lines. I'll readily admit my own laziness here...<br />Therefore, it works well for measuring circumferences which is what someone using this for tracking fitness progression would want.

It is cute; for example, the charging port is disguised as a little shell. So far, so good. The good stopped there.<br />The instructions are in such tiny print they are hard to read even with reading glasses. When I read them, though, it got worse. You are supposed to remove your makeup before using the brush. Excuse me, but removing makeup is one reason I would wash my face. They want me to clean my face twice?<br />Then I tried to use it and found it is not well-designed for using on the face. Faces have hollows and ridges and need something flexible to get to them. This device is rigid and will not reach many areas of my face other than my forehead and cheeks.<br />This might be a comfy way to massage my neck, but this is not a product I would use for my face.",negative,0,2021-05-21,Health & Personal Care

The only problem with this is that you end up having to either store the cloth and sponge applicator separately, or just let the sponge sit on top of the polish. After a few months, the polish has dried a bit as well.",positive,1,2012-07-05,Health & Personal Care

B06XSL1K8K,Best GERD relief investment ever I bought the Kingsize version hoping to remedy nightly reflux from a hiatal hernia and slipped it between my 2 inch foam topper and mattress and fully inflated it. The difference it made in my reflux symptoms the first night was a welcome HUGE relief. This was a $300 investment worth compared to buying a $1200 adjustable bed. It's hard to believe that it's only 8 inches of elevation - looks and feels like more - but it made all the difference that 4 to 6 inch elevation never did with wedge pillows and blocks. It also improved my husband's episodic snoring and made a significant difference in his sleep quality as well. I highly recommend anyone with nighttime reflux try this Genie.,positive,0,2019-05-28,Health & Personal Care

Before anything else, they are so poorly made that you can't even open the tubes!  Forget bending the tube as directed!

And yes, it burned when touched the gums the first couple of times, and actually left a white stain on the edge of the lower gum, which I had trouble removing. The stain remover would work better if you could actually rub the stains with someting less flimsy than the ""Q-tip"" swab provided...  The extra pen works pretty well.  In all, very cheaply made and not worth the price!  Concentrating on a few front teeth, I was able to get rid of some stain and whiten my teeth a shade.

B004C7MTLA,"Sustainable is a total lie Please use vegetable glycerine... There is no sustainable palm oil, it is a lie. Globally, 193 critically endangered, threatened and vulnerable species are threatened by palm oil production.<br /><br />Palm oil is used in all sorts of everyday products from shampoo to chocolate, but it’s been disastrous for the world’s forests. Here are five not-so-fun facts about ‘certified sustainable’ palm oil, which is often anything but.<br /><br />1. Palm oil is cheap – and we’re using way too much of it<br />Palm oil is a vegetable oil – like sunflower or olive oil. It’s made from the fruit of oil palm trees – Elaeis guineensis – which come from West Africa but were taken to Southeast Asia in the 1960s. Palm oil can be produced sustainably – but a lot of it isn’t.<br /><br />Palm oil is great for big food and cosmetics companies, because it’s cheap and versatile. It’s used in many of the things we use or eat every day: shampoo, bread, toothpaste, detergent and even snacks and chocolate bars.<br />Not only do roughly half of the processed goods in the supermarket contain palm oil, but millions of tonnes of palm oil are going into the tanks of people’s cars. More than 50% of palm oil coming into Europe (but not the UK) is for biofuel.<br /><br />2. Palm oil is a major cause of forest destruction<br />The palm oil industry has been a disaster for the world’s forests, wildlife and climate. Palm oil is mostly grown in Indonesia and Malaysia, two tropical countries with large areas of rainforest home to tigers, orangutans and other species that are found nowhere else on earth.<br /><br />Palm oil companies have been destroying these rainforests because they want more land to grow oil palm trees.<br />Around 24 million hectares of rainforest were destroyed in Indonesia between 1990 and 2015, according to official figures from the Indonesian government. That’s an area the size of the UK. Palm oil and paper companies are the main causes of this destruction.<br /><br />3. Palm oil is devastating the world’s wildlife<br />Destroying forests and replacing them with palm oil plantations wipes out critical habitat for animals that have nowhere else to go. Half of the Bornean orangutan population has been wiped out in just 16 years.<br />More than three-quarters of Indonesia’s Tesso Nilo national park, home to tigers, orangutans and elephants, has been converted into illegal palm oil plantations.<br /><br />4. ‘Certified sustainable’ palm oil is a con<br />In 2004, the palm oil industry set up the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). RSPO members have their palm oil ‘certified sustainable’ and brands using this palm oil get to claim that their palm oil is ‘sustainable’.<br />Most supermarkets in the UK and many consumer brands like Nestlé and Mondelez use RSPO palm oil in their products.<br /><br />The RSPO took 14 years to ban its members from destroying forests – which it finally did in November 2018. It still hasn’t enforced this new rule – and RSPO members are still destroying forests and getting away with it.<br />RSPO members were right at the centre of Indonesia’s 2015 forest fires crisis. This year, the fires returned – and roughly three-quarters of the fires linked to palm oil companies were on RSPO members’ land. This means that so-called ‘sustainable’ palm oil growers are – in some cases – at the forefront of Indonesia’s environmental crisis.<br /><br />5. Brands have broken their promise to end deforestation for palm oil<br />Back in 2010, some of the world’s biggest brands promised to protect forests and clean up the palm oil industry by 2020. That’s less than two months away – and companies are miles away from ending deforestation for palm oil.<br />Many still don’t even know where their palm oil comes from. In fact, there’s no way for brands to tell how much forest is being destroyed to supply them with cheap palm oil.<br /><br />Brands have broken their promise to clean up the palm oil industry. To save Indonesia’s rainforests brands have to use less palm oil – and any palm oil they do use must come from suppliers that are 100% deforestation-free.",negative,1,2021-01-26,Health & Personal Care

In this I was disappointed.<br /><br />This product has very useful and attractive packaging; the black case with ring can be kept on with keys so you always have these on hand. That is an excellent idea, and does work as the black metal container is small, light, but stout.<br /><br />The plugs themselves are rather difficult to insert fully. If inserted lightly, they only reduce sounds slightly. If inserted more deeply, which takes some effort -- do so with care -- they do reduce sounds more substantially as desired, but this comes with a pronounced roll off in the high frequencies.  So as far as &#34;high fidelity&#34; goes, I cannot endorse these. The level of reduction, subjectively, is about half that of the typical &#34;safety industrial&#34; foam plugs.<br /><br />For tonally neutral noise level reduction, such as for live music or performance on stage etc., I will be continuing to purchase other products that actually do perform that purpose well.",neutral,1,2014-07-14,

But this unit has a metal coupling which fits robustly, no leak, nothing, just works the way it should.<br />I recommend this product. I have been using this product for about 6 months now & it just works well. Only once it's filter light become on permanently whether I am using the filter or not, but the unit was replaced by Amazon at super fast speed!!<br /><br />This is an addition to my existing comment above. I have the same issue of filter light becoming on after few months of successful operations exactly like the first unit had the same problem.

B079Y7VGJB,"Both regular and chocolate peanut butters taste great, but packaging isn't great These are small packets of peanut butter, date paste, coconut oil and salt.  The chocolate flavor adds cocoa powder and Stevia.  Both taste great, but the ingredients separate so the packets have to be kneaded to re-mix the ingredients.  Unfortunately, the packet seals aren't the best so you may end up with a bit of ooze from somewhere, anywhere along the seam.  This happened to me with 2 out of 10 packets.<br /><br />Part of the problem is likely the date paste.  It ""needs"" a lot more kneading to re-incorporate and it's thick so perhaps I am more vigorous with these than with other similar products without dates.  But the dates really do add a wonderful sweetness and more complex flavor than other plain nut butters.<br /><br />These are convenient for packing into a pocket or backpack (make sure to include wet-wipes in case the seams break) for a quick, healthy snack.  But they are very expensive for just over 1oz of peanut butter.  Justin's makes a similar product (I haven't tried it) that is about half the cost-per-pouch for the same size, if cost is an issue to you (no date paste though).

The Coenzyme Q10 is the Ubidecarenone form which has to be broken down in the body to the Ubiquinol (CQ10). This is a problem for older people because the ability to break it down is declines with age. Fortunately I am not old enough that it’s a problem. The Vitamin E is d-alpha tocopheryl acetate which is okay but I’d rather have just simple d-alpha tocopheryl.  I was disappointed to find listed in the “Other Ingredients” section on the label is polysorbate 80.

This makes a little over 100 gallons of disinfectant suitable to killing the coronavirus - probably more than I'd ever need. The amount of Lysol I'd need to buy to get the same amount of quaternary ammonium chloride (the stuff that kills the coronavirus and other bad stuff) in this product would cost well over $5000. Talk about a bang for your buck.,positive,0,2020-05-20,Health & Personal Care

Thats where the good review ends.  The box and metal cutter are pretty flimsy and I am always in danger of loosing the end of the floss back into the box.  The biggest concern I have is the weakness of the thread.  My first floss lasted a few seconds and the floss broke.  A second peace broke in the same spot. After four breaks I pulled out a different brand and flossed that tooth with no breakage.  I tried going back to my original floss and broke it twice before a successful round could be completed.  One break or two I can understand but this was too much.  The slightest sharp edge on a tooth renders this worthless.",negative,1,2020-07-12,Health & Personal Care

B000G2BESO,"Wish I bought more! First of all, those complaining about how &#34;loud&#34; this product is must love sleeping in complete silence or extremely enjoy keeping their house so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. My tower fan in my living room and bedroom are louder than this device. If you're used to sleeping with a fan on, you'll just scoff at everyone complaining of the &#34;noise.&#34; I did. The UV light is slightly under the brightness of a night light - the lights on my router are brighter - but if you enjoy sleeping in complete darkness, this would be a problem for you.<br /><br />I'm amazed at how well this works! I was skeptical, but was drawn in with the promise of not having to change a filter and this device not taking up any floor space. I purchased it with the hopes it'll greatly decrease the litter box smell in my room (my cat and I share my bedroom) and I recently got a roommate that smokes (even though she smokes outside, the smell lingers in our home and, unfortunate for me, the a.c. unit is in her room, so whenever the ac comes on, smoke smell gets blown through our home!) It has dramatically decreased both smells overnight and I'm already waking up less congested! I can't wait to see how everything will improve after a couple of days.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this for a living room unless you want to buy multiple units and place them on either end (which I was tempted to do and now wish I had done, but I didn't know this plug ins worked as well as they do). I personally bought the 11inch table top fan by Germ Guardian for the larger living space, but that's another review. For a bedroom or office, it'll be amazing.

I also had a theory that that is was you get when you buy a pump that doesn't plug into the wall but charges - they are bound to lose pressure/suction over time.

To have any tension relieving effect, you have to pump it up to the point that it is practically choking you. At best, it provides some neck support, but a neck brace would do better. Adding to my frustration, I only used the thing twice before it broke and will not inflate. The tube to the pump has an egg in it, and there is no apparent leak anywhere, but the hand pump won't push any air. It just comes out the valve whether open or closed.

B07SY7QGTH,"Already wearing and tearing, wish they came in a bigger size I bought this particular posture corrector after recommendation from a friend and because it also helped your lower back. I’ve had it for about two weeks now and have used it on and off while sitting at my desk. I have a relatively broad chest/shoulders so I bought the large.  the shoulder straps can get uncomfortable (it feels like you’re wearing a backpack with very tightened straps) and they were at the end of the strap. I definitely feel like it’s changed my posture. But the waist band isn’t fully effective if you have a little bit of a belly, this may not be for you. the elastic back straps have already started wearing and some of the elastic has broken possibly due to over stretching and I’ve only had it two weeks (See photos). Definitely wish they had a XL. it probably would have fit me better. More than likely going to end up returning this one and finding a different one.",neutral,1,2019-11-14,Health & Personal Care
B09XF51CH2,"Seems to aid elimination and regularity There are many, perhaps most supplements that frankly are just not necessary. If you eat a healthy, mostly plant based diet with quality grown foods, you're probably supplying your nutritional needs already. I like to experiment, though to see if I notice any tangible results in a product, so I gave chlorophyll a go. I like using liquid suppliments because I don't like swallowing pills or tablets and if I have several products, I can add them all to a small amount of water in the morning. But in the constant rush they sometimes are not taken. Gummies seem to be all the rage now and I'm seeing everything now available in gummy form. If you take multiple gummy products you  might be overloading on sugar, so that's a factor. First a note on chlorophyll. Is it necessary? It's said to offer a host of purported benefits, many related to help keep your system clean and detoxified. None of those claims are scientifically substantiated though some studies with animals seem to support that chlorophyll has aided in shrinking some forms of tumor. I don't consume enough plants rich in chlorophyll, like say, spinach because of fear of the oxyllic acid that can have negative effects like kidney stone formation. I tried wheatgrass which is 70% chlorophyll, but I couldn't handle the taste. I've been using these gummies about 2 weeks and have noticed they do seem to help with regularity, which is hugely positive. It causes a strange phenomenon where the bowel movement has the appearance of a moss cover log from a tropical Forrest; sorry if that's too graphic. But that tells me it really is having some effects. As for the gummies themselves, the consistency is firm and easy to chew. I'm not a fan of the taste but it's easily tolerable. The cost per day seems reasonable as well. It this a must have supplement? Probably not if you eat lots of green plants. But I will probably reorder when this order is exhausted.

They make super quick work of shaping your nails and then you can use the same file to buff and polish the tops as well and they come out very polished and shiny -- look great and you can do each nail (shape and polish) in a hot second!<br /><br />They only have the file on one side and the end is also smooth for you to hold onto.<br /><br />They are washable and come in a nice container for storage.  Because they are so small, it is easy to take them in your pocket, purse, glove box, whatever -- they take up no space.<br /><br />They seem pretty robust so I expect them to last a long time -- much longer than a traditional nail file.<br /><br />The only tricky part is that you have to get used to using a file with no bend or give to it since these are a hard surface.

Some folks might just use their mop heads to clean floors.  Not me.  Mine is confirmation of a life well lived.  I am fortunate to have the means to afford a ten dollar mop head while others make due with less expensive models.  In my youth, I cleaned floors with mops with sponge heads and folding wringers like a peasant.  I was ashamed but it was all I had.  Gradually, I worked hard and earned enough to buy a string mop and I thought that I was someone.  It did its job, but I had to wring it out by hand and the head was attached and couldn't be replaced.  Then I saw an infomercial late at night for a string mop that would wring itself with the twist of its handle.  I sold my old mop, picked up some overtime and I bought one of these marvels of engineering.  It seemed like 6-8 weeks that I waited and finally the UPS man left a long, slim box leaning up against my mailbox.  I ripped open the box, giddy with excitement, only to find that it was cheap Chinese junk.  Flimsy and plastic.  I was devastated.  Then and there I vowed that I would never again clean floors with inferior equipment.  I took a second job and saved my money until I could buy a commercial mop, bucket and wringer like the pros use.  It's a yellow Rubbermaid unit that is built to last.  It has wheels on it and warnings in English AND Spanish to let people know that the floor it wet.  There is a clever baffle in the bucket that keeps the water from sloshing out should I have to stop abruptly.  I have arrived.  I can mop my floors with my head held high.  This mop head is more than a tool.  It is a reminder that I can do anything I set my mind to.  Thank you, Amazon.

This includes not only the plastic stock, the metal pole and the extra stout internal and external power cables, but also the superb packaging.<br /><br />But, unfortunately, when I turn the light on, the issue surfaces: just as the Hawaiian reviewer below notes, the ""natural"" light is white, dim, and very directed to the area under the lamp.  I am typing this review under the light, and find it uncomfortable to even see the keyboard. And I have perfect, eyeglassless vision. It is unnaturally white and glaring. Although it has two intensity levels, there is an odd, Twilight Zone glare to this light.  I see nothing ""natural"" about it at all, and frankly, after using it for a couple hours last evening, I had a headache. I have another light by a different manufacturer that looks almost identical, but was 50% the price of this Verilux, and it casts a pleasing yellow glow that I find stellar for reading.  I much prefer that light.<br /><br />I may well use this Verilux in my bedroom reading chair because, admittedly, it will be good for directed light that is less likely to wake my wife than the more general cast of an incandescent bulb.

And Thermos maintains its reputation with this first-rate cold drink bottle.  At 26 ounces, it holds plenty of liquid.  I put ice in mine, which lasts well over 12 hours and keeps drinks as cold as the refrigerator.  The screw-on cap is some sort of soft rubber-plastic combination, easy to wash, along with the bottle, but not recommended for dishwashers.  Small down side compared to a flip top, perhaps, but it screws on and off tightly with 2 or 3 twists.  It's fairly large and heavy compared to other stainless bottles, but the advantage is the amount of cold liquid you can take with you.  Even at its large circumference, it has fit any backpack bottle storage I have tried.",positive,1,2009-11-15,Health & Personal Care

I can maintain a more normal pace.2) It is easy to use on buses,trains and in restaurants because it it slim and stands upright or slides under a bench to get out of the way.3) I can still use it in more narrow spaces by lifting up the seat a little to reduce its width and can still lean on it while walking. 4)It was great on a two week trip through France and Italy- planes,trains,buses,uber and it only couldn't handle The Rome Collosseum and Pompeii.

B08T5XHPGG,"Nice sized shaver but lacking some desirable features This rechargeable electric razor does look and feel cheap as others have mentioned. I do like the shape of it as it is easy to hold. I wish there was some texture on the body to provide a better grip. I used this to shave the bikini area and I thought it did a great job. The size of the shaver head was perfect for me for that area (much easier to maneuver compared to my old battery standard sized shaver head which I'd been using for years). I didn't experience any snagging of the hair as others have mentioned. The hair was pretty long but I just went over it with a light hand until it got short and then I got a close shave. I like that one side of the blade is curved for the under arms and bikini area (although I did those areas just fine with the straight side too). I think the biggest thing that I don't like is the way the blade/ foil is removed in order to clean. Mine was a mess inside because there was some kind of lubricant/vaseline type substance in there and the hairs were all stuck. I had to wipe all that gunk out. It wasn't the easiest the clean compared to my old shaver. I feel like this new one is not really meant to be cleaned or it would've had a better design to open up the shaver head. Another issue is that this is not to be used in or around water which is kind of inconvenient. I think the only thing I would put under water is the blade/foil once it's removed from the body. I wouldn't trust rinsing it under water while attached to the body like they show in the product video. On my unit when the blade/ foil is removed, I see a little piece of sponge/ foam in the center and underneath that it looks like it's opened into the handle. Definitely don't want to get water in there. I wish there was an included protective cover like my other shaver. I like that it is rechargeable by using the included micro USB cord. The handle glows red when it's charging and turns off when it's done. There is more to be desired but it gets the job done so it's not a total waste. I also don't know why the box says 'epilator' because it is not.",neutral,1,2021-03-12,Health & Personal Care

I love to cook, but as I live alone, I usually don't bake my favorite recipes because the standard sized bake ware I own meant there would be too many leftovers.<br />Sure I could freeze some, but food never tastes quite the same when reheated, so when I was offered the opportunity to receive these Wholeness Home Bake and Serve Bowls with Spill Guards in exchange for testing and review, I was happy to accept.<br />These 3.5&#34; w x 2.5&#34; deep Bake Ware Bowls are the perfect size for an Individual Serving of Mac & Cheese, Casserole, Soup, Bread Pudding or anything else you can think of!<br />The are made of Non Porous Stoneware, which means they won't absorb food odors, flavors or stains.<br />The feature I love the most is the Silicone Spill Guard!<br />All too often, the foods I love to bake the most end up dripping down the sides of the bowls an onto the cookie sheet, leaving me with a big mess to clean up.<br />For testing purposes I decided to treat myself to my Homemade Baked Mac & Cheese.<br />I removed the bowls from the Attractive, Easy to Gift Wrap Box and Styrofoam Inner Packaging.<br />As suggested by Uniware in the easy to understand instructions that came in the box, I gave the Bowls, Lids and Spill Guards a quick wash before using them.<br />Then I par cooked my noodles in a saucepan, mixed them together with my milk, butter and favorite cheeses and filled the Bake and Serve Bowls with Spill Guards in place.<br />I topped them off by sprinkling some crushed up garlic and butter flavored croutons over the top and set the Lids in place.<br />Into the oven they went and I sat down to read while I waited for my Mac and Cheese to cook, stomach growing the entire time.<br />When the stove timer told me it was time to remove them from the oven, I was very pleased to find that my Mac and Cheese had cooked evenly, retained it's moisture and the croutons even had a bit of a crunchy brown texture from the heat generated by the Stoneware Lids.<br />Best of all, the Spill Guards had protected my cookie sheet from sticky melted cheese drips!<br />I removed the Spill Guards and was pleased to find that they had performed exactly as described. My Homemade Mac and Cheese looked like it had been prepared in a fine restaurant and it tasted delicious!<br />Clean up was a breeze with some soapy water, a sponge and a hot water rinse. No scrubbing needed! These Bake and Serve Bowls are also Dishwasher Safe for those who are fortunate enough to own one.<br />As I could only eat one, I put the other in the refrigerator and warmed it up in the microwave the next day for my lunch. The Stoneware kept the mac & cheese moist and tasting as good as it did the night before.<br />Uniware shipped quickly and offered excellent follow up to my order. I found them to be a very pleasant company to do business with.<br />I am extremely satisfied with these Wholeness Home Bake and Serve Bowls and will be purchasing another set come Holiday time to gift to my<br />sister for her and her daughter.<br />Well deserving of the A+++ Recommendation I am giving them!!",positive,1,2015-05-05,Health & Personal Care

Other than those 2 items, it is a great little scooter and will definitely make your life easier if you need one!",positive,0,2019-12-07,Health & Personal Care

I blew various numbers, including .19. I had not been drinking at all. After blowing several times, I got 0.  Then gave to my loved one, and he blew 0.  He tried again and blew .19 a few times. Then I blew .19 again.<br /><br />I was all set to return it, but decided to try again this morning, 10 hours later. The results are more believable this time.  He still has some alcohol in his system, .03.  I'm 0.<br /><br />Comments:<br />1. Make sure the device is fully charged.<br />2. My loved one seems to have a hard time not blowing spit into the device.<br />3. The device retains breath from one time to the next. If I blow after my loved one, I register >0, but if I do it again, I get 0.  If he got a lot of spit in the machine, I get lower values each time I blow until it gets down to 0.  If he blows after me, he registers less than after he blows a second time and subsequent times.<br />4. It's easier to blow directly into the tube on the device than into one of the mouthpieces, bug the mouthpieces do trap some of the moisture.<br /><br />I've got another couple of weeks to try it out, but I think it's going to work ok.

I have been using Irish-Moss on a daily for over a year now, and can vouch that this product is very good and consistent in quality, with minimal smell and sand to wash off. Reviews that say it smells bad, must just not know how to process Irish moss properly for culinary use. It takes about 24 hrs total (with soak) for it to be ready. And once you do all the steps, like washing off the sand, then washing with a little baking soda, then soak for 30min, then drain and soak again for 30 min, then drain and soak in a large mason jar in refrigerator for 24hrs, this product has absolutely no smell, has expanded to its full size, and is very light in color. After this process, there is no smell, and it’s ready to be turned into gel or stored as is, in a glass jar in the refrigerator.

B004O2A29E,"Contact Cleaning Magic! Thumbs Up! This product is amazing!!!!! I use saline rewetting drops with my contacts they leave a pretty gunky residual on them very quickly. I have been wearing these contacts a little over a month now(bad I know, but they are really expensive now). I used this product as the instructions directed and it removed all of the gunk that was built up. My contacts look and feel like I just opened them. The solution composition is 3% hydrogen peroxide. In the bottom of the cleansing case is a neutralization disk. According to the box, you must leave your contacts in this container for six hours so the disk can fully neutralize the solution and prevent eye irritation. If you do this, you can take the contacts straight out of the cleansing case and put them in your eyes without the need to rinse with saline. I personally rinse them anyway, but that's my preference. The only information I wish I had known is that you are supposed to replace the cleansing case after you finish one bottle of the solution. So, I would recommend buying either the set of one bottle and one case, or they do make a set that comes with two bottles and two cases. Both of these items are also sold by amazon. I feel like this product will extend the life of my contacts better and keep my contacts clear. I highly recommend this product.",positive,1,2017-04-27,

It does have a child proof push down cap to open. Bottle says it is a dietary supplement Solaricare 20:1 polypodium leucotomos extract 240mg. 60 mg capsules. Has UPC, lot number and an expiration date of 9/18 (over 2 years from purchase).  Suggested use as a dietary supplement to take one capsule twice daily.

It is made with a natural skin prevention of certain skin issues including sunburn, eczema (atopic dermatitis), psoriasis, vitiligo, and skin cancer.<br /><br />Background: The reason I opted to purchase this particular product was I have a Solar/UV allergy that causes me to break out in hives.

I like the fact that it has St. John's Wort so I think this may have helped my mood and elevated my spirit.  I believe it put me in a calmer state of mind.  St. John's Wort is a popular herb that is used to treat mild to moderate depression.  It, also, contains Ginkgo Biloba which is a great herb for depression, to slow down the aging process, for eye disorders and heart disease.  It may be good for cancer and many other diseases.  While I cannot say I see a pertinent difference in my brain capacity I did see an extreme difference in my mood.  After I finished the bottle I felt more agitated and stressed.

It came in it's own thin box with no padding whatsoever. It's laughably ineffective, but not in a funny way.  Instead of making two quick swipes DOWN each shower door (small shower with crazy calcium deposits lurking in every drop of water), I have to make 9-10 swipes from SIDE TO SIDE of each door, so that I can overlap and get all the areas it misses, which is almost everything.  For performance, it's dirt poor.  I even tried applying pressure to the squeegee edges, but with lousy results.  I really, really DON'T LIKE IT.  And I still have to dry out my shower with a towel.  Pros? It looks pretty, and hangs perfectly, with ineffective blade protected, on my hot/cold hardware (unusual design, probably would not work with most) .

To be fair, the product label does say to start with a clean shower and I did clean thoroughly before using, but build up was still visible.

They claim the bone broth is from Organic Grass-fed pasture raised, No hormones, No antibiotics, Non-GMO, which is all good but they do not back anything up and MOST IMPORTANTLY, there are NO third party quality assurances about what is going on.<br /><br />After finding no quality assurances about this company anywhere on the internet I threw the bulk of this away in the garbage.

B01JFW7A7O,"Interesting, Fun, But Not Without Issues - The Quest Doesn't Work So Well For My Needs The Hoover BH70700 Quest 700 Bluetooth robotic floor vacuum is easy to setup, including the Bluetooth connection to your phone.  The box has basic instructions in the inside flap and is pretty much all that is needed to have the Quest 700 doing its job.<br /><br />The Quest isn't noisy at all.  It is actually quiet compared to other units on the market.  It does okay on our ceramic floors and moves around at a surprising pace.  There are a few areas I had trouble.  I have a plush carpet.  The Quest has a harder time maneuvering on this thick carpet.  It travels at less than half speed compared to the hard ceramic floor and the worst part, it gets stuck easily on anything on this carpet.  I don't understand why, but the speaker stands for my surround sound system seem to attract the Quest.  The stands have a base that is about 1/2 inch high and the Quest always gets hung up on the base.  I have to physically get up and move the Quest off of the base to allow it to continue.<br /><br />The Bluetooth phone connection works better compared to the IR remote that also came with the Quest.  The IR remote is only line of sight, meaning the remote has to be pointed at the vacuum to work.  If the Quest is behind something, the IR remote will not work.  The Bluetooth remote works even if the Quest is behind furniture or walls with in about 15 to 20 feet.  With this Bluetooth app you can steer the vacuum away from trouble areas, command it to spot clean, go home to charge, and a number of other functions.  The Bluetooth also allows you to program a schedule for the Quest.  This is convent, but it would be nicer if the unit could just navigate on its own without my intervention.<br /><br />Run time varies depending on the floor type.  On the ceramic flooring it will run a good 35 to 45 minutes.  On the carpet this time is reduced to about 20 to 30 minutes before it starts looking for the charging station.<br /><br />The collection chamber is easy to remove, open and clean out.  The volume of the container is rather small requiring frequent emptying.<br /><br />In our bedroom we also have plush carpet.  The Quest would make its way under our dresser.  The dresser has a wood skirt around its base.  Once Quest is under the dresser, no matter how hard it tries it can't find its way back out.  This is a major pain as it always stops way in the back near the wall making it very difficult to retrieve.  Because of these issue I can only give it 3 stars.<br /><br />All in all it is on par with others in the market place and might be what you need or looking for.  If not for our carpeted areas my star rating would have been higher.  The carpet and hang ups are my issues.",neutral,1,2016-10-10,Health & Personal Care

I did just purchase the 60ml set of 2-30ml bottles, and those both came exactly as expect it to.

All I did was pull it out of the box, place one AA battery through the twist off bottom and turned it on.  Was a little nervous of the blades pulling on the hairs but never had one snag because the blades are recessed.  It does take some time and wiggle to get all the hairs because of the recessed blades but does a good job.  An unexpected feature was the little spot light below the base to see what you are doing.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and have no problems with this device.  The price is right, too!

B088STQXVN,"Easy to grasp and use, but the sponge is so dense that it doesn't dry quickly While I really like this design in some ways, the sponge is somewhat difficult to remove and replace because it is dense and likewise never seems to dry out because it is so dense. The sponge appears to be made from cellulose. The idea is that you squirt liquid soap onto the side with holes that lead down to the sponge. This creates a reservoir of soap that can be released when you squeeze the sponge. The soft silicone bristles feel nice on the skin. There is a slit in the bottom of the silicone casing where you can pull the sponge out. I initially tried hanging this bath brush in an airy spot with the sponge inside, but the sponge hadn't dried at all after 24 hours. I pulled the sponge out and put it in an airy spot, but it still took two days to dry out. So, if you use this every day, it's never going to dry out and will probably start to mold.<br /><br />I like the size as it is easy for me to hold while using. The side that doesn't have holes has projections that are a little stiffer and rougher, presumably get rid of dead skin or stubborn dirt. There is a loop for hanging or to put over your wrist when using it. The scrubber can be used without the sponge by squirting the soap on the bristles, but the scrubber doesn't hold its shape well without the interior sponge and so is more difficult to hold. I'm thinking of trying to find a softer, easier to squeeze sponge that might fit in this. The main body of the scrubber is 5"" long by 3"" wide by 1.75"" deep.

B013GKMF7G,Perfect for always having your fave oils with you! Updated 8/16/16:  WARNING!!!!! GLASS VIALS BREAK EASILY!!!! After refilling a vial o gently started to put the dropper top back on the vial & the vial SHATTERED into a million pieces in my hand. It badly sliced 2 of my fingers and cut & bruised a 3rd. I've noticed this has happened to a number of reviewed that have bought this product more recently. I was lucky & the vial broke over my sink so my young son and dogs didn't get injured because it would've been impossible to find all the shards of glass.  The vial didn't just break it splintered into a 100 pieces.  SO SCARY!!! I threw away all the bottles. It's not worth the pain and injury it caused.<br /><br />Perfect for stowing a few fave oils in my purse and laptop bag so I will never be without! Ignore the pipettes that come with it. Much easier to use the dropper head already in your oil bottle to drop the necessary amount of oils needed in these little bottles.<br /><br />Update: I've had this in my purse or laptop bag for several months and it looks brand new.

It is very neutral in flavor, which for me is a plus, if you like big olive flavor, this is not for you. It seems to be well-produced. I say ""seems"" as there is much controversy in the olive oil industry, and claims made are hard to substantiate. So for me, this would be a good choice. BUT! The bottle.

B00STSUPCS,"A large supply of a good quality supplement for overall joint health - easy to swallow caplets that promise good benefits I'm a tall man and I work out pretty regularly, and I do occasionally have joints that complain. I had heard about the combination of glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM, and had been meaning to try it out when I had a chance to try a sample from Viva Labs for the purpose of testing and review. I've purchased a number of their other products and have always been happy with the quality, so I was happy to try these.<br /><br />The caplets are easy to swallow. The recommended daily dosage is two caplets per day. I've been taking them for about a month now, and I haven't noticed any of the usual (but occasional) joint pain. I can't say for sure whether this is the reason, since I'm not able to compare the results with a placebo in a large double blind study. I do know that research supports an overall increase in joint health with these supplements and I'm fairly confident that Viva labs is a good source with a quality product.

Using these bath bombs took my bath to a whole new level!<br /><br />When I took the first one out of the box to use, I made the mistake of unwrapping the clear plastic, that surrounded the bomb, by my vanity sink rather than the bathtub.  Even though the bomb was completely intact, there were “crumbs” in the package that spilled out onto the bathroom floor.  Lesson learned!  Always unwrap directly over the bath tub.<br /><br />The bombs had a very pleasing  light citrus smell.  I am somewhat fragrance sensitive but these had an aroma that were pleasing to me.  Once I dropped the bomb into the tub, it fizzed and dissolved very quickly leaving the nice aroma in the air.  I was surprised how soft the bomb made my skin feel.  Not over oily, but enough to feel like there was a little oil in the water.  It felt luxurious on my skin and did not irritate it one bit.<br /><br />Perhaps I would buy these for a gift, but at the very expensive price, I would not be able to justify buying them for everyday use for myself again.

B0B3NL9Q5D,"Odd quantities of nutrients I take supplements because you can never seem to get enough nutrients from food alone these days. I won’t take ones that are synthesized in a lab, though, because your body rejects the chemicals. It can only use what is natural (meaning plant- or animal-based). This supplement is all-natural, vegan and organic, which is good. However, I have some issues with it.<br /><br />These tablets are entirely plant-based. You can immediately tell from the color and scent that beets are one of the major ingredients, since the vitamins are rose-colored. They’re also made of several berries, ashwagandha root, guava, mango, mustard and holy basil. They’re coated with carnauba wax.<br /><br />The smell is strong, and the taste is bitter. The tablets are small enough, I haven’t had trouble swallowing them so far, but someone with issues swallowing may need to crush and add the vitamins to a beverage or breakfast food.<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends taking three of these daily, preferably with meals. However, I can only take them once, because they make me so hungry! I’m not sure why, since the amounts of each nutrient are not as high as some supplements. The percentages are so random. When you take all three recommended, you may get as much as 500% of Vitamin B12 and as little as 9% of the amount of zinc your body needs. Those who cannot take iron or iodine should not use these, as they contain both.<br /><br />I don’t want to have to take half a dozen pills to get the level of vitamins and minerals I should have. Nor do I want to feel ravenously hungry all the time. Therefore, this supplement is not a good choice for me. If taken as recommended, you’re paying almost $40 for a one month supply, which is about $1.33 per day. That’s more than I prefer to spend, especially with the aforementioned issues. There are a lot better plant-based supplements available that have more standard amounts of nutrients and don’t make me feel half-starved.",neutral,1,2022-08-19,Health & Personal Care

B0925WV3YH,"Very Attractive Container, Nice Soft Pads--Update I got this for my wife, and here is her review: This is such a pretty little makeup remover pad holder, and it looks good just about anywhere I put it. The black tin has interlocking gold-trimmed leaves on both the lid and the bottom of the container, with a nice gold band around the center of the container separating the lid from the bottom. When the lid is removed, there is an inner gold-colored lid with a black knob. Lifting the inner lid, I see the makeup remover pads--there are 16 pads in all. The pads are black with gold trim around the edge, very elegant looking, and are 3 1/2"" in diameter. The flip side of the pad is black with a different pattern of gold trim, also very classy. The cotton material of the pads is very soft and gentle to the touch and when wiping my face. I love the fact that both sides of each pad is usable, and the pads themselves are all washable and reusable. Washing instructions are on the box--machine or hand wash in warm water. There is even a soft little 100% cotton mesh laundry bag to use. The box then says to place them on a dry towel or flat surface to dry. The online instructions say they can be dried on a low heat, but since they're 70% bamboo cotton and 30% regular cotton, I think I'll just let them air dry rather than risk shrinkage or distortion. I am very impressed with this makeup remover set. Though I am keeping this set for myself, I consider it very giftable and an excellent value. --Update: My wife likes these pads so much I also ordered a set with a pretty pink and lavender container that has pink and white pads, and a set with a pretty blue container that has light blue and white pads.

Once we removed the battery cover on the backside, it almost never fit back well. The same goes for the batteries. We were always having to pick up the scale, push the batteries back in and the same for the battery cover almost every time we used it. Eventually, I tried to use tape to keep the batteries and battery cover in place. However, that wasn't the only issue. Soon, it started behaving like it was always trying to sense a weight. It was always cycling on and burning out batteries about once a week because it was always on. I tried to troubleshoot the issue on Fitbit's site to no avail and it seems there are a lot of people with the EXACT same issues on their support message boards.

I am elderly, have a severe hearing problem and have used multiple devices, hearing aides and amplifiers.  I contacted Banglijian customer service twice, they responded within 24 hours both times.  I followed the instructions in their users manual. It took me a while to learn how to adjust the sound and get used to the devices. They are comfortable, hold a good charge and make a huge difference in my ability to hear. I would rate them as four stars based on the above facts and also the reasonable cost. They are easy to maintain and durable.<br />UPDATE, It's now October and  the amplifiers are still working well. Have ordered more Banglijian Wax Guards from Amazon and also memory foam tips for the devices. One of the pluses to using these Amplifiers during the Pandemic is they don't fall off when you are wearing a mask, the over the ear Amplifiers do. UPDATE. January 4, 2023.  Still using these Hearing Amplifiers daily and They are working just fine.",positive,1,2021-09-17,Health & Personal Care

B005DKJLDE,"Can't believe this made it on the market! Very awesome concept, absolutely terribly executed.<br /><br />1: As others have stated, it relies on suction cups to adhere to the bottom of the tub, and if your tub is textured (as the vast majority are nowadays) then the cups can't form a vacuum to actually stay stuck. And if the entire pad doesn't stick to the tub, then it floats. So it wants to float and wrap itself around you, which is not at all comfortable and is actually quite unsettling. Once the motor is on, it's like riding a mostly deflated pool floatie that's stuck to you and exploding in a thousand places.<br /><br />2: It's LOUD. Not just slightly annoyingly loud, but WIND TUNNEL loud. Both the motor unit and pad create an incredible amount of noise. Bathrooms are generally small places that echo. The sound from this thing reverberates off the walls making it absolutely impossible to relax. Someone could be getting violently murdered in the next room and you would never know. Honestly, I've been in full size professional spa whirlpools that could fit 6 people that were quieter than this tiny thing.<br /><br />3: The air is COLD! I don't know what this whole ""heat maintenance"" thing advertised about. The little jets of air coming out of this thing (right against my skin, remember) were ice cold.<br /><br />I was so excited to receive this as a Christmas present.

B08GL1668C,"Did someone make a massive mistake at the company? I’ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for decades and have purchased numerous models over that time and never have Oral-B ever sold them without a brush or two included in the package. However, this very expensive AutoBrush package doesn’t contain the very item that allows you to do what is intended, namely, the brush head (see my photo). The question should be, if you’re selling a toothbrush, can you still call it that if you don’t actually include the brush head?<br /><br />What you’re paying for is the body of the toothbrush, the charger, the charging adaptor, and its cable. The side of the box says that the brush heads are not included. However, the listing says otherwise - “Brush Head Included”. But it’s not. Not only that but you can’t even buy the brush head on Amazon! You have to go do that on their website directly. They’re $10 each.<br /><br />Not having the brush heads means that I can’t really test the efficacy of the brush and their stated claim that it works better than normal brushing. But, after turning on the unit and grabbing the metal prong where it connects with the brush head to feel the vibration, I have to say that it feels extraordinarily weak. I fail to see how these micro-vibrations will do anything to remove plaque. The power put out by Oral-B or Sonicare is 10 times stronger.<br /><br />In summary, this all seems “too good to be true”. First, they don’t include a brush head in their kit – even though they say that they do. Then, the weak vibrations from the motorized body feel like my iPhone vibrations.

The problem with them is the smell. I also don't want the ones made of plastic and toxic chemicals. So I started searching for a silicone hot water bottle wondering if they made them.

I was disappointed at first because I'm used to the large hot water bottles. But I thought I would go ahead and give it a chance. I love this hot water bottle! I found out that I actually like the smaller size. It has such a nice silky feel to it being silicone instead of rubber. And because it is smaller it is not as heavy. I fill it with really hot water and it lasts long enough. I liked it so much that I ordered two more! Don't be intimidated by the small size.

B002ZU2EVG,"Disappointed . . . This pillow was a disappointment to me, but it may work out okay for my husband, who is larger and has broader shoulders than I.  I tried it for two nights and both times ended up swapping it out in the middle of the night, unable to sleep comfortable on it.<br /><br />To be honest, I already have one of these pillows and have used it (and loved it) for years and bought this one for a second location.  My original was a hand-me-down and had no tags on it, so I cannot be certain it was exactly the same manufacturer, but it looks the same  (and I've not found others on the market) and the length and width are exactly the same.<br /><br />Why this one falls short:<br /><br />1.  While the length and width are what I expected, the height is much greater; the original being a little less than 4&#34; and the new one being more like 6&#34;.  The additional height on this one bends my neck out of the proper resting position.<br /><br />2.  Both the bolster (tube) and the pillow are stuffed so full of filling that they are very hard.  In my original, the bolster is firm and the pillow is soft.  In this one the bolster and pillow are both very firm.  I really do not detect the difference in firmness between bolster and pillow that is described in the listing.<br /><br />3.  It does not fit in a pillow case, not even a king-sized case.  My original easily fits a king-sized case.  This one can be crammed into one, but doing so completely defeats the purpose of the bolster/pillow design.  I have temporarily pinned a towel around it and will make a custom pillow case  to fit if it turns out my husband likes it.<br /><br />I thought about washing it to see if that would soften it up, but it has no laundering instructions.  I looked to see if there are special cases for it and found none.  I also looked around to see if the pillow comes in different sizes but found no alternatives. I wish they made a smaller one.<br /><br />In fairness to the company, I did not complain or try to return it, or test their &#34;satisfaction guaranteed&#34; promise.  I did not pay much for it and it so far it is working okay for my husband.

B00EYZLGIW,"Great Machine but only lasted 18 months I really like this distiller.  I has more stainless steel than my previous distillers from Sears.  The bottom of the top half is stainless, (it was plastic in my Sears distiller), the spout is stainless and the fan blades are stainless.  Nice.  The point of failure in my first Sears distiller was the rubber gasket, this machine has a silicone gasket which I expect will last longer and seal better.  The company includes a cute little tool (also stainless) that positions the spout over the receiving bottle.  I had never seen one before, but I enjoy using it, and it keeps dust out of the bottle as it fills.  I really can't complain about my Sears distillers.  I bought two and they have given me 23 years of service.  Over the years various parts have failed, but I was able to swap them with each other.  The only criticism I have of the Tinton is I wish it had a knob on the top so it could easily be lifted off.<br />Also I received the distiller one week after ordering it,  Amazon had estimated a much longer delivery time.<br />Update:  It is now Jan 31, 2016 and the machine no longer works.  It did not come with a contact number or trouble shooting guide.  The past few weeks it was cycling on and off every 5 minutes, as if it was too hot and automatically turning itself off.  There are small burn/melt marks next to the 'ON' button.  It will stop working after a small amount of water is distilled--maybe a cup.  Since my prior Sears distillers lasted for years, I am disappointed that this machine has died after a year and a half.",neutral,1,2014-07-18,Health & Personal Care

All of the ten repair markers were cover to some degree with an orange, waxy substance. It took forever to get the substance off of the markers. Some of the makers were permanently stained and others lost the wording on the marker when the waxy substance came off. The substance had also seeped through the cardboard packet and was oily so when I left it on my cherry wood table the oil left a ring – so another mess to clean up. Only two of the fill sticks had the pointed tip of a new “crayon” all the rest had flatten tips some to the point of being only half the size as the rest of the sticks.<br />I tried the repair markers out first and they worked well matching the wood in color. The fill sticks were terrible. I wanted to fill in a little nick on my kitchen. So, I ran the stick over the nick and nothing happened. Then I tried again and the wax “crayon” filled in with little crumbles, I tried to smooth the crumbles out and it all fell out.<br />This product is made in China.",negative,1,2021-07-09,Health & Personal Care

B08JBSBBBM,"Easy saline nasal irrigation system! I did alot of lawn work today which got my allergies worked up a bit so I decided to try out the nasal irrigation.  I had not done this before, so I wasn't sure what to expect -- kind of figured it would be a bit painful or burn as the saline went through my nose -- but it wasn't at all the case.  It was very easy and painless.  I emptied one of the saline packets in the bottle and filled it to the 300 ml mark with warm/hot water and tested the water temp with the term gauge/strip and it was right in the middle of the ""green"" (for good).  I leaned my head forward a bit over the sink, put the plug in my right nostril, tilted my head down to the left (so my left nostril was below my right), and pushed the release button the bottle.  I watched as water poured out of my left nostril and barely felt anything (just kind of smelled the salt water).  After a few seconds when I thought the bottle was about half empty, I switched sides and watched the water pour out of my right nostril.  The bottle never completely emptied -- I think that it may stop when there is not enough water pressure to keep forcing it through your nasal passage, so I ended up pouring the last ounce or two out after the treatment.  I did keep my mouth open and reminded myself to breath the entire time as instructed.  Easy peasy.  After the treatment, my sinuses feel free and clean.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE:<br />* Effective and thorough irrigation of sinuses with no pain or discomfort<br />* Release button on bottle lets gravity release the water at the proper rate (rather than squeezing a bottle and getting to much pressure)<br />* Good directions<br />* 2 adult nozzle tips in different colors so my wife and I can each have our own tip<br />* 1 child nozzle tip<br />* 30 saline packets for 30 treatments<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Looking forward to using this during allergy season to keep my nasal passage clear of pollen after spending time outside.",positive,1,2020-11-09,Health & Personal Care

I've tried the Lemon Balm, Stinging Nettle, and Oil of Oregano drops and what you get is exactly what is shown and described on the product pages.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />Each ""dose"" comes its own little tube. Easy to open the first time, and the nifty little cap can be replaced if you don't use the whole vial at once by turning the cap upside down and placing the open end of the cap on the tube. I don't know, however, how long it will stay fresh once it's been opened & re-capped if you don't use it all at once.<br /><br />Reasonably priced for a 30+ day quantity of liquid herbal supplement. (30+ days because if you use less than one tube per day and finish off the tube the next day, it will, of course, last longer.)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The only con for me, is the taste. Of the three types, the Lemon Balm drops tasted the best. Very lemony without the sourness.<br /><br />Stinging Nettle drops tasted a lot like the way a fresh cut lawn smells. Not horrible tasting, but I didn't like it.  (This is just me, someone else may love it!)<br /><br />Oil of Oregano tasted kind of like a bland, but slightly bitter, mint. I liked this one the least of the 3 flavors.<br /><br />Sooo... these are one of the ""sitting on the fence"" type products. The things I didn't like were personal taste, and every person's is different. I can say that I had no bad effects from any of them.<br /><br />[Cross-posting to all 3 flavors pages.]",positive,1,2022-06-01,Health & Personal Care

B01LYCSJM8,"I don’t feel that it is likely that I will try the Sprayzee Shoe Deodorizer a second time Review of:  Sprayzee 100% Natural Shoe Deodorizer & Foot Spray<br /><br />I’ve tried the Sprayzee Shoe Deodorizer on 3 different pairs of tennis shoes; one pair for general walking around in, another pair for use at the gym and a third pair of shoes I wear out in the garden.  And, so far, I’ve come to a couple of conclusions about the Deodorizer.<br /><br />The first item, and the most obvious, was the aroma of the spray.  While the spray promotes itself as some version of mint, to my sense of smell at least, the aroma was closer to being medicinal; something similar to a pine-scented all-purpose, floor cleaner.  While I did not find the smell to be even vaguely pleasant another family member mentioned that the smell wasn’t too bad, almost a peppermint-type aroma.<br /><br />The second thing ‘discovery item’ for me was to realize that I should always use the spray outside.  I first tried using the spray in the garage and discovered that the ‘aroma’ of the spray covered the interior of the garage and lingered for at least a day.  This, to me, is an indication of the power of the spray which is a plus.<br /><br />The next item I noticed was that the bottle itself was somewhat difficult to use.  The spray nozzle worked fine when positioned upright but didn’t work well, or at all, when positioned sideways or upside down.  This meant that I found it hard to spray up inside the body of the shoe without having to manually hold and maneuver the shoe with one hand while spraying with another hand.  And, of course, I found that this led to the spray getting on my hands and the ‘aroma’ getting on my hands.  And, this in turn, led me to understand that the spray, with it’s unpleasant smell, was not easy to wash off my hands.<br /><br />Finally, after letting the sprayed shoes sit for a day or so, outside, I determined that the spray had indeed cut down on some of the original foot-odor the shoes had a day earlier; which is what the product is intended to accomplish.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found that original odor had been replaced with a odor that was half foot-odor and half pine-scented floor cleaner.  To me, that aroma was perhaps a little better than the original smell, but not by much.<br /><br />I will most likely continue to use the remainder of the product but I don’t feel that it is likely that I will try the Sprayzee Shoe Deodorizer a second time.",neutral,1,2020-12-18,Health & Personal Care

B09GXYBSJH,"Almost Too Cute to Use This gift set consists of six cute bath bombs in assorted shapes and colors. The cover of the box has pink on the left blending into lavender in the middle and blue on the right. It has a white silhouette of a female soaking in a bathtub getting ready to pop one of the many bubbles floating out of the tub. The sides and back of the box have the same color scheme. The back includes directions on how to use the bath bombs and a generic list of ingredients, which are sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, sodium sulfate, organic shea butter, sea salt, essential oils, and FDA approved colorants. When the box is opened, the contents are covered by bright pink crinkle cut paper. Removing the paper reveals the six bath bombs, each individually wrapped in plastic, resting on more pink filler paper. There is no plastic opening tool. The six bath bombs are each different shapes and colors. One is a green and yellow doughnut with lemon scent. One is a pink. blue, and yellow star with cotton candy scent. One is a blue heart with gold glitter brush strokes that has a rose scent. One is an orange macaroon with a white center and with a ""milk"" fragrance (smells floral through the wrapper). One is a cupcake with a lavender cupcake wrapper, white icing, and tons of multicolored sprinkles on top that has a lavender scent. The last one is a round ball with blue icing and a rainbow on top sprinkled with blue glitter. The scent for this one is sweet orange. These bath bombs have natural and organic ingredients. The bottom of the box clearly cautions ""Do not eat!"", although the online information says the ingredients are ""edible grade."" I suppose this is just a reassurance in case I accidentally get any glitter or other ingredients in my mouth. These little bath bombs are almost too cute to use, and I'm going to put them on display in my bathroom for a bit before I indulge myself with them in the bathtub.

Going zero waste is a huge goal of mine, and this was a step in the right direction.<br />I don't know if I'll be reordering this one though. It's a weird balance between not wanting to get my fingers all weird and covered in the deoderant and it feeling super hard against my skin.  Like it's hard to spread, it doesn't go on well at all.

B000G2BESO,"Humidity affects performance in a major way--needs water vapor to work properly Try to understand its limitations. Any device using UVC will produce some ozone. PCO devices require water vapor to produce hydroxyls instead. If you have humidity of about 60% it will probably work well. If humidity is low you won't get much hydroxyl action and its fresh feel, and will have irritating incomplete chemical byproducts. Some expensive PCO devices like Air Oasis place a gel inside to keep a supply of water vapor available for the process. I am considering one. Professional remediator units such as Titan hydroxyl generators specify 60% humidity.  I bought this small Germ Guardian and put it in my basement and was very happy with it.  Yay, i'll get more I thought. I bought some for other parts of my house and there was a very irritating smell. Put them in the garage to run and &#34;off gas&#34; and it was more horrible still.  I sent all back but one in my basement which is still performing.<br /><br />Well now I know that it was probably the humidity levels that were the issue. I'm in a very dry climate. My basement is cooler and has higher relative humidity than the rest of my house. So elsewhere in the house, I was getting ozone but little to no hydroxyl. Ozone is prone to leave breakdown products from VOCs. Here is a study of an industrial-level-remediation hydroxyl generator, which indicated it took about five days to completely break down house-fire type smoke odors in a testing room. http://envair.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mike_Pinto_Hydroxyl_Radicals_for_Fire_Restoration_Part_2_Study_Final.pdf.

Pulled out several cardboard containers with visible mold. Sprayed this https://www.amazon.com/EnviroKlenz-Fragrance-Free-Non-Toxic-Treatment-Upholstery/dp/B01I00V9II all over the floor and put my Germ Guardian in the pantry with a jar of water and a fabric pad sticking out to help diffuse it into the air. So get busy lil hydroxyls and decontaminate my pantry! I will leave it for several days and re-evaluate.  Seems weird to be adding humidity to the air where mold is found, but we'll see.

They're silicon, so they should be easy to wash.<br /><br />The only negatives I can find are that they do get a little damp if you wear them long enough.

B08P2WYLHH,"Some things to consider before you buy. For the most part, these insoles are pretty much what you’d expect by looking at the pictures, so I won’t restate what’s obvious and stated in many other reviews.  But I will list below some things that might NOT be quite so obvious, and that you should think about if you are considering purchasing this item:<br /><br />The insoles themselves really don’t offer much (arguably, none, in my opinion) arch support by themselves. You’d have to add the little sponge pads to the insole in order to get any significant amount of arch support.  Note that these insoles DO NOT have a built-in hard plastic arch support like many other insoles and orthotics do. In my personal opinion, if what you seek is a very firm, high arch support, the ones having the built-in hard plastic piece under the arch may be a better option for you.<br /><br />Insofar as the sponge pads that you can stick on, that sounded like an attractive feature to me initially, because I could customize the support/padding to my personal preference.  But I feel there are a few downsides to this that you should consider:<br /><br />It can (and probably will) take several trial-and-error adjustments to get a pad positioned “just right” so that it feels perfect. Doing this requires you to stick the pad on, put it into the shoe, and walk on it. But then you have to remove the pad, move it a little, and stick it back on, and walk on it again. Still not perfect? Do it again!  Because you’re removing and reapplying that pad, the glue is likely becoming less sticky with each removal. Meaning, the pad becomes more likely to later lose its grip on the insole and slide out of position while you’re walking long distances, especially if the insole gets warm/sweaty or wet for long periods due to water leaking into the shoe, or even just perspiration..<br /><br />Even if you manage to stick a pad on in the perfect position the first time and never remove it, I am still concerned that the adhesive will eventually give way and with the addition of friction between the pad and the shoe itself, the pad may slide out of position over time. And then it will become uncomfortable and not provide the desired support.  Consider how annoyed you might get if that happens. Would you be annoyed? (be honest!) Would you consider it to be wasted money?  If so, perhaps you might not want to take the risk and maybe a one-piece insole would be a better option for you.<br /><br />The insole relies on the use of the stick-on pads not only for arch support, but for heel and forefoot padding as well (if you want that). So on my insole, I have a pad under the forefoot, a pad under the heel, and two pads stacked under the arch.  While some might love to have that level of customization, I actually find it rather overcomplicated and kind of Macgyvered to “make it work”, if you know what I mean. And not very visually sleek in my opinion (not that this matters much, given that it’s on the bottom of the insole).  I find that I’d much rather just have a one-piece insole that comes with good heel and forefoot padding built in, and a hard plastic (and high) arch support.  Something that I can use right out of the box, and be happy with.  Yes, it takes some trial and error to find the perfect model for my foot, but once I find it, I will likely just keep buying the same one for each new pair of shoes and not have to spend time on trial-and-error fitting anymore.<br /><br />If you found this review to be of any value whatsoever, I would appreciate a quick click on the ""Helpful"" button below, to let me know that I’m not completely wasting my time putting these reviews and tips out there.

I've used the Downey with the pump bottle, but frankly, pumping that bottle was really hard on my hands after awhilel (you know...trying to fix the laundry my family left in the dryer too long). I thought the  aerosol spray might be easier on my hands. But here is the problem: it sprays out a long stream (tested over many bottles I bought at once) and so it soaks the material rather than providing a diffuse spray over the fabric. It works in a fashion, but the delivery system of this bottle really holds the product back. I have tried cleaning the nozzles, angling the bottle to no avail. From the very first spray this product refuses to make the mist really required to work properly. I feel the contents of the bottle qould work nicely if the delivery system IMHO was not sub par.

Hopefully the seller continues to carry it, because it's one of the few color safe bleach products on the market, that is both low in odor and liquid free. It removes stains well. It's perfect for my artificial perfume/ fragrance allergy family. I've used it for years and it's definitely economical, one box can last two-and-a-half to three months; that's doing at least one load of laundry every day.

Unfortunately I have long hair and for the life of me,  50% of the time it will not catch properly.  Instead it will spin outside of the chamber, twist my hair into a dread and cause me to have to pull it out.  The other 50% gives me such great curls that I'm on the fence on whether or not to return.  I know it's not user error as I've tried every imaginable way to ensure it catches properly but I believe it has to do more with the spinning""catcher"" around the barrel.  If it's not dropped in as just so and catch just right, you're screwed.  I honestly want to love it and use it just like all these reviews and videos show.  It's perfect, compact, easy to use in the car, etc. So many positives but yet, it will be so time consuming if i can't get it to work right 50% of the time.<br /><br />UPDATE: spent about 45 min on Saturday trying to figure it out.  Had it on a full charge.  Curls came out cute however dealt with too much twisting that this isn't time saving for me.  Lastly, got about 3/4 thru when the curler died and had to recharge.

B000GCRWNA,"Perfect for chaffing and blister prevention I'm an avid runner and have some sensitivity to my own sweat. This brings about raw chaffing from seams on sports bras (and I've tried almost every brand in the 10+ years I've been running). I came across a similar product years ago which I can no longer find and this cover roll is almost identical! No, chaffing products like body glide do not do the job - at least not nearly as well as this cover roll . I run 1-2 times a day and tape up my chest area where the bra seams and chest strap will sit and enjoy the run  and happy to get as sweaty as I want! I also use it for hot spots on my feet. Long distance runners will know what I mean when you've run your shoes in but not ready for a new pair. This cover roll prevents hot spots and blisters! And if you're breaking in a new pair of shoes, tape up the likely areas on your feet and you're ready to go! On occasion I have used cover roll for large grazes over a dressing and you can get through multiple showers without changing the dressing. It adheres very well and will peel off nicely if you peel on a 180 degree back over the area. Don't try to peel it off by ripping it off or pulling in a 90 degree angle from the area... you could end up with missing skin! Do it correctly and you'll feel comfortable dressing and redressing twice a day. Also, this seller gets the product to you before the estimated time by Amazon.

For this purpose the size and weight are ideal. It does shave relatively well but I would not want to use it on an indefinite daily basis. Again for travel it is fine. My main complaint is that although it charges via a USB the supplied cord has a proprietary plug. Thus you must use this particular cord to recharge it. Lose it or forget it nd you out of luck. Much, much better would been for it to use a standard micro-USB plug like many others do.

I have long hair, so o makes it hard to hold the dryer in a position where my hair isn’t hanging close to the end.

The writing on the back is all religious and about God which is NOT what I wanted to buy or read about in a PH balancing item--I wanted something that actually worked for balancing the body's acid levels and, if it does-one would never know how to use it because this product comes with NO information except to say the ingredients include Prayer and the anointing of God on the back of it. Really?? Who else is reviewing this-have they not noticed this issue?<br />I am pretty angry about this and have to go online to try and find the instructions but feel like I should just return it since I feel pretty duped...it seems like the bottle the old carnies at the carnival days used to sell.

B08L788WMK,"Did A Pretty Good Job On My Bathtub I have an older porcelain bathtub that has become more and more difficult to clean as it has gotten older. It probably needs to be resurfaced, but I’m not looking to do that anytime soon. I’ve tried all kinds of cleaning products and just haven’t gotten the results I wanted, even with a whole lot of elbow grease. While researching cleaning these older tubs, I consistently found peroxide was the recommended cleaner. So, I got GreenFist’s Hydrogen Peroxide All Purpose Cleaner Spray 32 oz (2 pack) as another attempt to clean the bathtub.<br /><br />I like the idea of a more natural cleaner than the hasher cleaners (some of which I have tried). I sprayed the tub down really well and took the electric scrubber to it. While it didn’t handle all the stains, it did clean the tub better than anything else I’ve tried so far. Bonus, I didn’t need a nap afterwards from herculean scrubbing efforts.<br /><br />The scent is fairly mild and has a somewhat citrus smell. It’s doesn’t leave a strong “fresh” scent like some cleaners, but I’m fine with that. The bathroom is small and I have to close the door when cleaning to keep the kitty from helping. Many cleaners can be overwhelming in the smaller, closed space.<br /><br />I didn’t see an expiration date on the bottles. It’s my understanding that hydrogen peroxide degrades, particularly after opening the bottle. I have no way of knowing how “fresh” this is or how long the effectiveness will last. I was also surprised to see it in a clear bottle, as I always thought it came to opaque bottles to help preserve it. Maybe this is different from medical grade peroxide? I suppose I will just continue to use it as long as it is being effective.<br /><br />I’m happy with the results for this product and will be trying it on other areas in the house.",positive,1,2021-05-15,

Very good hot water bottle plus handsome sleeve with reindeers – gives very Christmas-y mood, especially when you feel the warmth from this bottle. The only thing is missing is spiced rum punch.<br />My hands and feet are often cold - no matter what. I was very excited to see this hot water bottle pack. We used to have one many years ago but then fancy electrical came and nobody used such hot water bottles anymore. The order arrived very fast and was packaged very nicely. The package came with instructions about how to fill the water bottle and close it properly - it also came with warnings about extremely hot water and using this item with children.  It was so easy to fill the water bottle and the cap was very secure upon closing the water bottle - no leaks/spills so far!! The covers are very soft and cozy - but I did notice that the covers did take away from a bit of the warmth that the bottle gave off. I filled the bottle as instructed and it very nicely warmed up my feet - but I chose to take off the cover first.

B004NFKW7O,"IMCO Super Triplex I just got my IMCO Super Triplex lighter today and I couldn't be happier with it. It is very simple to operate, the design is very cool and it lights on the first strike every time. It is nickel plated steel and has a ten year warranty. I got the Super model because it has a slide to adjust how much airflow reaches the flame while the standard and slimline models just have open slots for air that cannot be closed. I was concerned that there would be some fluid loss when I was not using the lighter if I could not close the air slots but the ""snuffer"" portion of the cap actually forms a seal around the wick when closed so I think the other models would be fine and the adjustable airflow does not make a huge difference in operation. The only negative thing I could say is it seems like it will chew through flints really fast! I have been striking it a lot more than I normally would just checking it out and showing it off but I have already worn the flint down half way in one day! It has a very aggressive spark, which is a plus in that it will always light on the first strike regardless of any weather but I would order a few packs of flints with it if you like to play with your new toys as much as I do.",positive,1,2011-07-26,Health & Personal Care

B071F4Z16T,"Too Expensive. An Excellent Product. But Not Good Value Because of the Cost Here's the deal. I am a huge fan of the Soylent concept.<br /><br />And one of the ways I maintain my weight and keep my weight down is by applying the philosophy of calories in calories out. And so, I have a protein meal replacement for breakfast that clocks in around 240 calories and has 39 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, 17 grams of carbohydrate and 3 grams of fat.<br /><br />Now, let's say that one wanted to maintain a weight with a consumption of about 2,400 calories per day. As Soylent points out, although one could, one shouldn't get all of one's daily requirements from just consuming Soylent.<br /><br />But if each serving of Soylent (24 servings per this cannister) is 200 calories and one were to use this product for two meals as a meal replacement, one could blow through a 24 servings container in no time at all, thus making it an expensive source for your daily protein.<br /><br />So how do I really review this product?<br /><br />Is it excellent? Yes.<br />Is it neutral tasting and not unpleasant and able to be flavored with cocoa, etc. ? Yes<br />If I could get it for a lower price would I use it regularly? Yes<br /><br />So the only comment I have is that it is a very very expensive way to do a meal replacement. If the 2.3 lb container is set up for 24 servings of 200 calories each that means that, for a daily 2,400 calorie diet, the container would be for two days.

B00QFXVOL0,"Sheds too much - Great customer service I am not a fan of this brush.  I used it for about 2 months then replaced it.  I like the way the brush whips up the shave soaps.  I do not like the way it sheds.  Shaving brushes are not supposed to shed on every use.  The brush leaves bristles in my shaving cream and on my face.  I put it in my kids bathroom and they have not complained yet.  Either they don't use it or they don't mind the shedding.<br /><br />Edit - I posted my 3 star review (above) on a whim.  Adam, the owner of Latherwhip, was very concerned about the shedding issue and gave me a refund after I told him that I did not mind the problem and it was good enough.  He went through the effort to find me after my post and make things right and he does not accept good enough.  He sent me two emails on Christmas day to do his best.  You can't beat this level of customer service.  I am going to give the brush another try.  Hopefully, I will follow up with my results.  If you are the fence about this product, give it try, the customer service is excellent.<br /><br />12/28/15 - Received my new brush today and gave it a try.  I gave the gold level treatment.  I soaked it in hot water along with pre-shave oil, a mixing bowel and a tube of Bigelow shave cream.  The brand new brush left a few small bristles in the mixing bowel, as expected.  I did not get any bristles on my face.  So far so good.  I will give the brush a thorough try and hopefully it will not shed.  I have to admit the fact that I like a new brush.  I don't need a new brush but I still like them.  This brush just feels good on my face.",positive,1,2015-12-24,Health & Personal Care

B01NC07ZE0,"Junk I bought this because I broke the plastic guard for the styler that came with my Phillips/Norelco YS524.  This fit my shaver, but it is *not* a replacement for the one that came with that kit. First of all this isn't adjustable, which I suppose is my fault for not reading the description or reviews more closely. More importantly, this trimmer was weak to begin with, and only got worse. It trimmed about a third of my face before it became too frustrating and upsetting to continue. It did such a poor job that I had no choice but to go back to the one with the broken guard and just shave my beard off. Made me so mad I tossed it in the trash and came to write a review. Bottom line, if you *need* your beard, look elsewhere. This isn't the trimmer for you.",negative,1,2018-08-14,Health & Personal Care

B003OXK95G,"DO NOT BUY THIS SAUNA - MAJOR DESIGN FLAW - YOU WILL LOSE YOUR $$ - DON'T BE FOOLED BY WARRANTY I purchased this sauna last summer and almost immediately it began to fail. It has a MAJOR design flaw. The cables do not fit into the dome snuggly. Therefore, sometimes the bottom heating unit wouldn't work and sometimes the top heating unit wouldn't work. After five months both domes stopped heating up altogether and it would not longer work. When I set it up initially, I only moved the top dome to slide over the bottom dome 4 times in 5 months, and I never moved the entire sauna once it was set up. So it is not as if I moved it a lot and the cables became loose. They say there is a 2 year warranty, but they don't tell you that you have to ship it to China to get it repaired and YOU have to pay for the shipping which will be hundreds of dollars, just to repair something with a design flaw that is going to break again soon anyways. At first the manufacturers didn't even want to do that and said that I must have moved it around too much. Never mind that it is supposed to be PORTABLE and should be made with enough durability to MOVE AROUND!! And as I mentioned previously, I moved it less than a handful of times in 5 months, so I knew that was not the case. They were trying to renege on their warranty. So don't be reassured by the warranty. You really have little recourse if they say no. Now they are saying they will fix it but I have to pay hundreds of dollars to get it to them, and it likely won't work for long anyways. No thanks. I have since spoken to other people who have owned this sauna and they say the EXACT same thing happened to them. Clearly it is designed poorly and is a low quality product. I'm going to take the loss and purchase a permanent unit so this doesn't happen again. Save yourself the frustration and DO NOT BUY THIS SAUNA!!

B002J8VWW6,"Well designed, sturdy, but they aren't completely stink free and yes, they actually do expire The reviews saying that the counts were off are unfortunate but I've not experienced being shorted. These kits hold a considerable amount of waste but it can be difficult to gauge how many uses you can get out of the, at least at first. You don't want to overfill them. Each kit consists of a small bundle of TP, a wet wipe, a larger bag and a smaller ziploc bag. The larger bag fits into the netting of the Cleanwaste toilet which eventually gets inserted into the ziploc bag. Setting up is easy -- drop the ziploc bag into the mesh liner, underneath the larger bag where it will wait patiently. When you go to gather up your waste in the larger bag, gently squeeze the air out, tie a loop to seal the contents, and your ziploc is handy for the next step of double bagging since you've stashed it in a place where you won't lose it.<br /><br />I can verify that over time, likely many years and with improper storage, the bags disintegrate and the Poo Powder solidifies and the whole kit is rendered useless. This unfortunate outcome was discovered when I came across what I believe was an ancient 12 pack that had been improperly stored or was just incredibly old.<br /><br />The issues about stink are a matter of opinion, but my expectations are calibrated appropriately. If you leave the waste in an enclosed space, the sun is shining or humidity is high, then yeah, there's a bad stench. Using extra Poo Powder doesn't seem to help all that much to ""cover up"" the stink, but it's reasonable.<br /><br />With each use of a bag, I get a pang of guilt that this is the epitome of single-use-plastic waste and the perfect example of an environmental problem in miniature.

B00EUI1XOA,"Good product BUT.... Let me start off by saying that I really wanted to give airfeet better than a three star review. However, there are a few big negatives that just crush the Product overall. Before I get to the good and bad break down, let me say I am a factory worker. I am on my feet for eight to twelve hours a work day. I only use air feet in my work boots. Now on to the bullet points.<br /><br />- Good<br />- After you wear them for about a week you will notice a difference and you feet will feel better.<br />- Works better than any off the shelf product I have tried. (Have tried many)<br /><br />- Bad<br />- They just don't last. Three months is the longest a pair has lasted for me. Again, I only wear them at work.<br />- Lack of durability. When these give out your sock, foot and inner shoe will be coated in a greasy, clear substance. It takes several days to get it out of your shoe.<br />- Company response to warranty claim. I have mailed back several pairs to the companies P.O. box for warranty replacement only to have the box returned to me after a week because no one picked up the mail at the post office. Then it's on to leaving messages and Twitter. (To be fair, I did get replacement inserts after four months of messages).<br />- Price. $48+ for a pair of inserts? Not at this quality level.<br /><br />If air feet sold for $15 or $20 dollars a pair I really wouldn't be as concerned. When your putting down close to $50 a pair and you only get three months use, that's a problem.<br />Again, when they are new they work great. Does this mean I will stop using them?

B07Q7S4JBL,"Great customer service, great back support! UPDATE #2: 17 day roadtrip and halfway through we had a heat wave of 100+ degree temperatures. I have fabric seats in a jeep and my options were to blast the AC and pay double for gas (6k miles is a lot of gas money already) or drive with the windows down. These saved us! The mesh support allowed the breeze to hit our backs and keep us cool. We used the air conditioning only in traffic when the wind died down. They held together well too. I didn't use them continuously but alternated on and off to give my back new positions and prevent stiffness.<br />I also brought them into the hotel room as support for sitting up in bed at the end of the day.  They were absolutely worth the hassle of carrying them in and out with my bags.<br />These are definitely going to stay in my summer road trip kit. Updated to 5 stars!<br />UPDATE: great customer service! Cartop has a great guarantee policy for defective products and is replacing my damaged item. Hopefully it'll arrive in time. I'll update again after my road trip.<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had lumbar surgery several years ago. It helped immensely, but I still have occasional pain. Especially if I sit too long (more than a couple minutes) in a chair without support.<br />These are actually great for my back. Not only in a chair, but while sitting in bed reading they provided just the right support and air flow preventing me from overheating. I felt the difference immediately. As soon as I stood up, I didn't need to stretch or move carefully for those first few steps like I always do. The ache was gone, which was such a relief.<br />However, one of the supports snapped its stitching when I tried to buckle it to the seat in my car. I hadn't even used it yet. Hadn't messed with the adjustable bands at all. I've used the other for all of 2 days and while it's fine so far, I'm concerned.<br />I purchased them for an upcoming road trip for my mother and I and I don't think they'll last those 2 weeks.

B07BJN87QK,"This is amazing First off, the cold packs are top quality. The exterior was thick enough to resist puncture or tearing, yet pliable enough to form to your body. It never got too cold and didn't have any hard chunks inside like others I've tried. It also remained cold for a long time.<br /><br />At first glance I was suspicious of the harness. The part that holds the pack is thick cloth on one side and thin on the other. I was afraid the thin side would let too much cold get through and would be flimsy. Once I put the cold pack in it became apparent the fabric was stronger than it looked and offer my skin more protection than I anticipated.<br /><br />My only issue was the straps. While the velcro was remarkably strong, the elastic strap felt like it would loosen up over time. It was also very small. Without the 2nd strap you would need to be the same size as the model on the box to use the product as advertised. (Full Disclosure: I did not use the item immediately after unboxing. I'm not sure if the 2nd strap was missing or if I misplaced it. In either case, I can't say how it would change the experience. For that reason I only deducted one star due to the strap size. I'll look for the missing strap tonight and adjust my review accordingly if I find it.)<br /><br />TLDR: Great product. The straps may not work for bigger people, but the packs and their holder are well worth the price even if you have to hold it in place another way.<br /><br />UPDATE: Okay, found the second strap. All of my concerns are gone. It easy fit around my broad chest and held the cold pack firmly in place while I unpacked my apartment. (I just moved.) With both straps, the shorter one didn't have to work as hard and didn't feel as delicate. I've very  impressed.",positive,1,2018-09-05,Health & Personal Care

I love the idea and that is why I rated it with 3 stars. The things in it are so good and important and needed for good oral health so when it was offered at a Discount for a thorough review I wanted to try it right away.<br /><br />It wasn't sealed for some reason or another (it might have fallen en route somewhere) and that's just not something we're used to in the US we have PSA's telling us not to use anything that isn't sealed for safety. Then, when I went to open it and it fell out on me like flour the camphor and menthol was so strong that I had pulmonary issues and started coughing.  I am admittedly sensitive to anything that is strong and I just hadn't imagined it being that amount.  I would have been very happy with it if it was sealed and the density of essential oils had been titrated lower.  Some may find this wonderful and love it because they don't have those sensitivities so I can totally appreciate the differences there.  Doing everything all over again I would say that perhaps more could have been explained on the page about what it is and what it is not. There should be a warning on the label for people who have pulmonary issues or maybe hay fever or anything with allergies because it was just too potent for me.  It's a difficult situation to be in because most places would barely put enough of something while this company put maybe a little too much, but that is subjective for me ... One can always double-up and add more powder to one's brush but if the powder is so strong already that it causes other issues then it's a little too far the other way maybe?<br /><br />Because of what is in it and and what it does it would be great for so many other things, which is another reason why I got it.  I'm sure it would help with a bug bite to draw it out like with a mosquito bite or a bee sting...<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great list of items all together<br />Strong recipe (almost too strong for my allergies, but maybe perfect and generous for people without them).<br />Bamboo Charcoal is a real bonus, it has so many great properties<br />Small container is easily portable and wouldn't be counted at TSA in the infamous tiny baggies and is 2 3/4 H x 1 3/4 W<br />Breath Freshener<br />Clay and Charcoal are natural detoxifiers and i use them already<br />Kills bacteria,  would leave the mouth fresh<br />Natural ingredients.<br />Charcoal isn't black in appearance so if it gets on you or your stuff it isn't hard to get off, doesn't stain.<br />Charcoal has a whitening effect on teeth.<br /><br />Cons/Tips:<br />Not organic, but it is natural.<br />Oils are too strong/powerful for people with allergies, if you have strong sensitivities or  MCS I'd say to avoid.<br />Redundant seal on the inside would have helped a lot.<br />Could mix this with baking soda or other charcoal to cut the power of it down and make it last longer perhaps<br />May want to use another natural product to help spread it around the mouth more easily, perhaps coconut oil.<br />An ingredient warning might be advisable on the label to advise users for those who may be sensitive or have loved ones who are.",neutral,1,2016-05-04,Health & Personal Care

I like the slickness that it gives to the drying towel as it soaks up the water and sealant.

B00C0T7IWC,"A quality device with limitations It is obviously a well-made and well-thought-out product, but here's the problem: although the manual is pretty much comprehensible, getting this thing to pull sound out of a TV and then wirelessly send it to the earbuds proved to be almost impossible. In the end I had to use the analog (red & white) leads and hook them up to the cable box - which means that only programming that originates with cable TV is delivered through the device. Well, I'd like it to feed all the sound which relates to the TV, but none of the analog ports from the TV produced sound in these earbuds. So, for example, when I'm streaming something and the sound does come from the TV it still doesn't feed this device. Believe me, I tried all the plugs. If anyone can tell me why this is and what to do about it I would greatly appreciate the guidance. Furthermore, the extra functions that this hearing enhancer offers are pretty much not on my list of needs - but there they are and I have to pay for them too. Why doesn't this company make a device that is specifically for TV sound, and then explain that it is not going to work except when hooked up to the cable box. Lastly, the earbuds that came with it are supposed to be mute-able, but that does not work. So I have to listen to the ads or take the buds out of my ears. Something very GOOD about this device is that I can walk away from the TV and around the corner and work in the kitchen and the sound from the TV comes with me. This is unique among the devices of this kind that I have reviewed.",positive,1,2013-11-30,

I would give it a minus were that option available I was abroad on business and with mere hours to go before my departing flight  I succumbed to temptation and purchased several pairs of a designer shoe, utterly gorgeous which had caught my eye several days previously.  I did not even have the time to try them on. Even the clerk's doubtful glances at my American size 8B feet failed to deter me. When I got home I had a formal event to attend and one of the shoes--as I thought it would--matched perfectly a gown I had decided to wear. Suffice to say that I had a bleeding heel at the end of the evening because I  had misread the Italian size charts.  The wound would not heal and was so sore it would wake me up at night. My dermatologist was on vacation but she had prescribed a self-adhesive foam dressing that  I used  up while she was away-- so I went on Amazon and using &#34;self adhesive foam dressing&#34; as my search term I came across this product. It specifically states it is for the heel so, expensive though it is, I bought it. It came promptly but even before I had tried it I had misplaced it  so I bought another.  Pardon this lengthy opening statement: I found the first box and took out the first sheet of the product---each dressing is sandwiched between two clean sheets of a plastic type material. I pulled out the first and removed the material protecting the adhesive, applied it to me heel and IT FELL OFF! There was no adhesive, none, nada zilch. I tried every dressing in the box and they were all the same--no adhesive! I then opened the second box and there was no adhesive on any of them.  I had spent $120 on nothing.

B094DVZZ9S,"Real? Pro: nice bottle, sensual fragrance, arrived early<br />Cons? I'm not sure if it's authentic. It doesn't smell like the dry noxious cedar smell of synthetic ouds in Montale or Swiss Arabian western oud fusion fragrances. Buuut, I can't be sure it's real. I got a mild headache even though it's a really faint scent. A dab of oil on my wrist only lasted 2 hours, and the smell stayed incredibly close to my body. In my experience, pure oud is very concentrated, so I doubt this is undiluted real oud. The smell was like leather and sangre de drago (aka, dragon's blood or fragrant palm sap). The acrid smell of the sangre de drago faded within a few min on my skin, and I was left with leather and a ghost of something sweet and mapley which was quite enjoyable but once that faded, it was pure new car smell. I don't have much experience with real oud to say if this is fake oud, or diluted real oud, but I can say that it seems unlikely to be pure since I had to put my nose directly on my wrist to smell it after an hour. In my experience with one real attar of oud, I used one drop and you could smell it a mile away for days. Perhaps age of the oud and the particular tree it came from impact the silage and longevity of this oud. Overall, it's not what I had hoped, but I'm glad I bought it with an Amazon credit and hope to try more ouds from reputable sellers to compare in the future.",neutral,1,2023-01-22,Health & Personal Care

B074PF1P7Y,"Pretty pricey Protein for not so amazing toilet bennies I don't do many reviews, but I felt compelled on this one. I was really excited to get this and try it out. Most of the reviews previous to mine were people reviewing the protein before they had even used it for an extended period of time. I wanted to wait until I had exhausted the entire container. First things first: The Good<br />The protein is exactly what you would want from a plant based protein. I found it tasted like Vanilla Chai Tea (which wasn't too bad for me). Each scoop contains ~20G of protein which isn't too bad either. At times I have found protein powders to bloat me up a bit, and I didn't get that from this. Overall I felt that is was a great product and stood up to its claims so far.<br />The Bad<br />Unfortunately I have to write this part, I was really hoping that I wouldn't find anything wrong and I could keep buying this as my main source of protein! The most obvious 'bad' about this product is its price point of ~$60. I didn't pay close attention to the amount that they give you but for 20 scoops of Protein, $60 is way too much. That is roughly $3 per scoop. There is no other protein (plant based or otherwise) that costs this much. If I were to use this as my main Protein, I would have to buy at least 2 containers just to get through a single month. I was really disappointed to get such a small container. IsoPure which, is on the high end of the protein suppliment market is about  $1 per scoop and give you 25 Grams of protein. Now I know Isopure is whey base, and this is not, but even Vega Protein (a competitor of this product) give you 25 grams per scoop at a cost of $1.50 per scoop. So for over double the price, I just didn't find that I got double the benefits..which I was disappointed about. If this were $35 or so (bringing my cost per scoop down to normal ranges) I wouldn't mind using this for a longer period to continue my trial and see if I realize other benefits, but it is simply too cost prohibitive.<br /><br />Additionally, I found that everyday I used this protein, my bowel movements were hard as rocks...rather painful at times, and even more uncomfortable to write about. :) Each day during my trial that I substituted use of lentein with my regular IsoPure protein, everything was immediately back to normal. Go back to this protein, and back came the Rocks...I don't know what caused it but I know the only variable I had in my dieting was the use or non-use of this protein.<br /><br />Bottomline, if you want an expensive plant based protein look no further. But for the price, I can't personally see benefits that equal the hole in my wallet. I honestly wish I could, because I wanted to love this product. Unfortunately it falls into the 'average' category for me.",neutral,1,2017-12-08,Health & Personal Care

Since taking this everyday I have been sick way less than in the years before and when I did catch something, it was very mild and passed quickly.  My wife instantly started sleeping better and all her &#34;menopause&#34; symptoms like hot flashes have disappeared.  There has been occasions when we run out and it's not a good feeling.  I agree with the philosophy of making sure all your body's cells have the nutrients they need to do what they need to do.  We enhance this brew with 5 drops of liquid vitamin D3 / K2 drops (ea drop = 2000 iu) and also some iodine / iodide drops.

I’m really happy with this oil. I think it’s actually been better for my hair than the other one. My hair is straight and fine. I apply the oil on damp hair, right after the shower. Makes it way easier to brush my hair and I noticed my hair is easier to manage overall without dryness. Initially, I really did not like the smell from the bottle. Although, after applying it, the smell seemed to dissipate pretty quickly. I really like that it doesn’t leave an oily layer or residue on my hair. It soaks in nicely.

B0B49HX86X,"Lets enjoy some TMI time... What you get is a box just like the one in their picture.  Inside are 50 individually wrapped NOT CANDIES.  I swear you could probably toss these in a bowl at halloween and kids would think (until they tasted it, I assume) that these are lemon candies of some sort.  As you can see the individual pieces don't have any indication that they are NOT for consumption, or even what they are.<br /><br />This is great for discretion I suppose, and the lemon smell doesn't smell like food lemon, but more like cleaning supply lemon, so hopefully no kids will eat these.<br /><br />Anyway, you plop one into the toilet and it seems to kinda fizz a bit like a weak alka-seltzer and the smell of lemon is there.  It's mild.  Not overpowering at all, which gives concern for it's effectiveness after an Irritable Bowel meets Dairy Allergies evening of discomfort.<br /><br />First, if you're in a rush (which I sometimes am due to having IBS) grabbing a pellet and ripping the (pretty sturdy plastic) packaging off and dropping it in the toilet might be the last thing on your mind.<br /><br />Furthermore, it states if you get this on your skin to wash it off immediately.  Easy enough at home, but why bother there?  Isn't this for when you're at work and don't want to embarrass yourself after the company chili pot-luck takes it's revenge?  I suppose if you're just at a friends house trying not to peel paint in their guest bathroom it's fine?<br /><br />Anyway, it plop-fizzes before you plop-whiz and to it's credit I would say that I mostly smell just the faint aroma of lemon.  Occasionally a whiff of my own brew would break through, but nothing too shocking.<br /><br />Also to it's credit I allowed my last creature feature to stew for a solid 5 mins after I was done and came back to a still mostly lemon smelling bathroom.  NOT BAD!<br /><br />On the not so great side, is if you have ever used a Bidet, which I do, I'm assuming others have also noticed while it's spraying your dark side after a particularly unpleasant deuce-drop, the spray can kick up the smell as it splashes those particles off you and into the bowl.  I can attest, these pellets being in the bowl and not up where the Bidet sprays, they do NOTHING to combat that aroma besides jazz it up with a hint of lemon.<br /><br />At the time of writing this review the price is about 32 cents per potty break.  I'm not convinced that this is something I'd use often, but perhaps if you're still young and dating and trying NOT to scare off a potential future spouse, or if you have exceptionally foul aromas.",neutral,1,2022-08-14,Health & Personal Care

A little big but they're some of the better ones I've bought and delivery was pretty darn quick.. Looking at the pictures, however, I was under the impression that each box came with ALL FOUR types of bandaids.. not just one type per box. Now I HATE leaving anything but positive reviews unless west I got was really bad or not corrected if my order was messed up but I mean who buys character/designed bandaids to only get one style. Not to mention my kids mostly wanted the ghost and spider web one and we got a box of ONLY pumpkin ones. Description did state something along the lines of ""style may vary"" except looking at the pictures, I thought it meant the boxes were different. The box we got and the boxes in the pictured on amazon even has pictures of all the other designs which is why I'm a little frustrated because I believe these are being falsely advertised. And if you're only going to include one style band-aid, at least let the customer choose which one! Bought these because we just found out that my 7 year old has type 1 diabetes and now needs lots of finger pokes and insulin. He likes bandaids after the finger pokes so after he was discharged from the hospital I went and ordered like 5 different boxes and was excited for him to get them but am now disappointed. If somebody is reading this and decided to order some, either buy 4 boxes or just know that you're only getting one style per box.<br /><br />I don't want a refund or to return the product because the bandaids are just fine and I would certainly change my review to 4 or 5 stars if this seller/store either mentioned in the description that each box only has one style or if they changed their boxes and included all four designs in each box so that nobody else is disappointed expecting variety and only getting one style.",neutral,1,2020-11-18,Health & Personal Care

Effectiveness: This is one of those supplements that takes a while to see noticeable results. The supplement contains a pretty basic formula with only a few ingredients.

Feel/Comfort: I didn't experience any stomach discomfort or indigestion while consuming the capsules.

B08W2615R7,"Passed the skin test on my wrist, but tingled and stung around my eyes. No results. I tried this cream for 10 days before I decided to discontinue use. When I first got it, I put it on my sensitive wrist skin to check for a reaction. I didn't react or have any issues, so I decided to try it on my face. I used it around my forehead, cheeks, and chin, as well as my chest and tried to avoid my sensitive eye area. It gave my skin a bit of a tingle, but nothing too terrible. I slept it off.<br /><br />After a couple of uses on my face, I went ahead and applied in my eye area. It began stinging the sensitive skin in the periorbital area, and was too tingly for my comfort. It did dissipate, but I was not keen on it. Thinking it might just be an initial irritation or perhaps too much sun, I have it two more chances at night with similar results.<br /><br />I haven't noticed any particularly astounding results with hydration or skin brightness, and I wasn't keen on the stinging and tingling around my eye area so I've discontinued use. It could be amazing for someone else, but it isn't for me.<br /><br />The top ingredients aren't particularly astounding either. I don't find it worth $48 to get the neat container that I can refill. I'd rather pay more or less for a product that won't irritate my skin, and will show some improvement in my dark circles and dry face. The first ingredient is water, the second ingredient is methylpropanediol which is just a surfactant, and the third ingredient is vegetable oil.<br /><br />Polyglyceryl-3 is supposed to be moisturizing and help with emulsifying. Polyglyceryl-3 is another emulsifier. Betaine is added for moisture, although I didn't see much improvement in my dry areas in the 10 days of use. C6-14 Olefin is another emoliant. It's rated a 1 by Skin Deep in the correct concentrations. Then there is shea butter, which usually leaves my skin soft and moisturized, but perhaps the concentrations are lower in this formula. From there, there's a couple dozen ingredients. I'm not sure which one or which combination irritated my skin, but this isn't one I'll buy again.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau*, Methylpropanediol, Vegetable Oil*, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate*, Betaine, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Dicaprylyl Ether, Angelica Archangelica Root Water**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Onsen-Sui*, Sodium Hyaluronate*, Bifida Ferment Extract*, Lactobacillus Ferment Lysate*, Lactococcus Ferment Extract*, Glycerin*, Panthenol*, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil*, Rubus Chamaemorus (Arctic Cloudberry) Seed Oil*, Buddleja Davidii Extract*~, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Extract*~, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyacetophenone, Tocopherol, Citric Acid*, Cetearyl Alcohol*, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate **Component of Icelandic Glacial Water *Natural or naturally derived ~Ecocert",neutral,1,2021-04-04,Health & Personal Care
