B09PMT3RF5,"Breakthrough Chemical Odor that Was Very Potent I love shower steamers, and it's rare for me to find some I don't care for. Unfortunately, these shower are definitely not ones I like. Both the menthol & eucalyptus and the lavender scents have an additional scent that has a very strong chemical smell almost like some sort of industrial solvent. It totally overpowers the smell of both the menthol & eucalyptus and the lavender shower steamers. The fumes were not only unpleasant, they actually started to give me a headache each time. I don't know if I just got a bad batch of these or what, but after trying one of each scent on different days and having the same thing happen each time, I'm not about to try any more. These six shower steamers come wrapped in shiny foil, three eucalyptus (green) and three lavender (purple). They lie on a bed of lavender filler paper, and there is a mesh lavender drawstring bag with an adhesive-backed hook to hang the bag on. The cover of the box is pretty and has a printed lavender ribbon with a bow on it. Two of the sides say ""Make your bathroom different!"". This has all the right stuff to make a beautiful gift, but the intense, unpleasant scent of these steamers make them something I don't even want to finish using for myself, much less gift to anyone else. I""m giving them a three star for presentation and the benefit of the doubt, based on other reviews, that the box I got is the exception and not the rule.",neutral,1,2022-06-15,Health & Personal Care

B01H7JCTN2,"Decent product, very expensive juice equivalent The product is fine, easy to use, that's 5 stars.  But the cost in juice equivalency is astronomical, 1 star.  So I averaged.<br /><br />The suggested dose of 1.5tsp (half a tablespoon) is nowhere near raw juice, which I researched after getting this product.  Most tests using beet juice to improve athletic performance have the subjects drinking 250ml or 500ml/day (1 pint, or 1 quart.) Looking at a straight juice product labe on Amazonl, 8 fl oz has 100 calories.  To get 100 calories from this dried product, you will have to use about 6.7 tablespoons in 8 ounces of water. The label indicates a pound bag has 45 tablespoons, so that's about 6.7 8 ounce cups, or about 1.7 quarts.<br /><br />That's $15.29 cents per quart of juice equivalent.  Using the lesser 250ml/1 pint quantity, that's almost $4/day for juice.<br /><br />I've been incorporating beets in my diet for awhile, but man, are they a pain to prepare!  And the red finds itself all over the kitchen.  A little over half pound of beets has that same 100 calorie comparison.  Since beets here in the USA cost a little under a dollar a pound to maybe a buck and a half, all depending, you can get your quart of beet juice with all the solids for $3-4.  If you get beets with the tops, yummy cooked greens or chop and put in a salad.<br /><br />Maybe Sprouts or Hole Paycheck has juice at a more reasonable price that what I can find here.",neutral,0,2017-03-11,Health & Personal Care

B009JQE6RO,"Not Bad, but not Great Either. I purchased this because I'm a huge fan of star/constellation projectors and thought this would be a cheaper alternative to a high-tech, expensive ceiling projector. The only color that I'm impressed with is the green, as two of the color settings are screwed up (it shows three different colors at once on the pink and blue settings, which I first thought was supposed to be like that but then realized that something is either broken or damaged inside of the device) and the red setting can't even be seen well. I would definitely recommend placing this on a high surface, as lower surfaces like a nightstand or most dressers won't project the images correctly, leaving huge, stretched out stars and moons on the ceiling.<br /><br />The sleep sounds are horrifying. There are only a few different sounds to choose from and each sound is incredibly muffled with static and it is just obvious that the sound box inside is of terrible quality. It also seems like the sound clips are only about 5-10 seconds long before they are repeated and it grows incredibly annoying after a while. After the first five minutes of trying the sounds out, I shut them off because I couldn't fall asleep. So, fundamentally, this does exactly what it's NOT supposed to do.<br /><br />I'm rating this 3/5 stars because, if placed in a good position relative to the ceiling and on the green (or blue, if your blue setting actually works) setting, this could be cool. My nephew thought it was amazing and couldn't wait to get to bed so that he could see the stars above him before falling asleep.

B00A3Z44R2,"Fantastic Quality and Noise Reduction The product was shipped out and delivered to my door quickly  with no issues. The details and description are spot on and these earplugs function just as they claim. In comparison with standard plugs purchased at retail stores like, Home Depot, Frys, Wal Mart, etc -<br />The reduction of sound in very good, and quite a leap from the cheap orange plug. They reduce ambient noise and high frequencies very well while not muffling everything to an unrecognizable tone. I find can hold conversations easily with these in. The ear buds themselves fit in very snug and are relatively comfortable, even for long periods, and are virtually unnoticeable. Overall the quality is good and these are made well. Cleaning and keeping sanitary seems like it will be an easy task, especially with the included case. The only reason I am not giving this product 5 stars is they are a little hard to remove and sometimes during the process the noise created from removal right next to the ear canal is a little loud, although I will state I have incredibly sensitive ears. So, While these are amazing and do a fantastic job at filtering sounds, they are not quite strong enough for myself.",positive,0,2015-07-13,

I've bleached, we've checked for mold, etc - to no avail.  Regardless, after reading Ona reviews here and in other online forms, I thought it sounded miraculous.<br /><br />How I used it: I put some of the crumbles in a small container under the sinks. These lasted at least a month, and were roughly about 4 ounces of crumble.  There is a LOT of product in the quart container.  In that sense, it does go a long way.<br /><br />1. I believe this product to be effective and more tolerable to the nose in the non-scented form.<br />2. the Apple form is just not at all &#34;apple&#34; - it's so awful, to be honest. It has no similarity - whatsoever - to apple fragrance. It doesn't even smell fruity, lemony, etc. It honestly reminds me of lysol gone rotten.<br />3. cost: very value-appropriate for how much you receive and the fact that it will work to eliminate the *original* odor.<br /><br />Bottom line: I thought this helped at masking the odor we had, but the odor of this product scent itself was worse or equally bad.

It takes 3 minutes to heat up, I section my hair in three sections on each side of my head (6 sections total) and take vertical sections and slowly glide the tool from root to end. If you go too fast, it won't straighten properly. If your sections are too big it won't straighten unless you take smaller sections. I get my hair smoothed and straightened in 10 minutes. My side bangs are too short to use this on, so I use a round brush and a blow dryer to get the perfect side sweep.

B07WCQZNX2,"Decent, but not outstanding with regard to strains and potency; average value This is a decent, but not outstanding probiotic supplement. It contains only 4 strains (3 Lactobacillus strains and one Bifidobacterium strain) which is on the low end. More significantly, it does not indicate on the ingredients how much of each strain is in the mix. That's a notable shortcoming since it could be heavily weighed on just one strain.<br /><br />The capsules themselves are easy to swallow. The dosage is 2 caps per serving. Thus, the claimed 40 billion CFU potency applies to using 2 caps per day. Each cap has a potency of 20 billion CFUs, making this on the high end of the price scale when you compare it with how long it will last.  The bottle states that the potency listed is at the time of manufacture (which is the usual situation) and that the potency should remain at at least 10 billion CFU per cap prior to the best-by date (which for a bottle received in June 2020 is Aug 2021).<br /><br />It works as well as other probiotics for me. I've not experienced any significant side effects, such as gas or bloating. However, when taking all factors into consideration, it's just an average (3 star) product. The use of only 4 strains, not providing concentration levels for the strains, and requiring 2 caps to hit the claimed 40 billion CFU potency make this only an average value compared with other probiotics.",neutral,1,2020-06-19,Health & Personal Care

Hartline in ""The Catholic Tide Continues to Turn"" spends a great deal of time on today's post-modern culture and attacks on the Church dating back to the Reformation. In the midst of what appears to be turmoil, Hartline notes that the Church has made great strides under the leadership of Pope Benedict XV1 - and these positive developments have not been covered by the ""mainstream media.""<br /><br />Hartline details Pope Benedict's visits to the U.S. (2008), and the U.K. (2010) which exceeded the expectations of the media and attracted massive crowds. He also highlights the World Youth Days and the lingering effects of both Blessed John Paul II's and Benedict XVI's on the youth of the world. Many have become the water and fertilizer for spring of the Church.<br /><br />There are many powerful forces converging to make this a great time to be a Catholic:<br />* Very good lay leaders and clergy are emerging<br />* The Church is providing greater moral clarity in a time when moral relativism rules<br />* There is a boom at the parish level in bible studies and catecheses<br />* Catholic Conferences and programs (Magnificat, Marian Conferences, Catholic Professional and Business Clubs, the Napa Institute, etc) are growing geometrically<br />* EWTN is now broadcast globally while Catholic Radio has expanded into nearly every major U.S. market<br />Catholic Internet news services, You Tube videos (including a Vatican channel), and blogs are bountiful<br />* The number of excellent Catholic authors and speakers - lay and clergy - has grown exponentially<br />* Converts are increasing as traditional protestant faith traditions implode<br />* The Church is continuing to grow globally...and in the U.S.<br />Orthodox Liberal Arts Catholic colleges as a preferred alternative are gaining strength and students<br />* Screenwriters, producers, and directors are showing a presence in Hollywood and in the media<br />* Eucharistic Adoration is growing rapidly in parishes around the U.S.<br /><br />As a producer of a Catholic speakers series, Catholics@Work, I see the good things underway in the Catholic American Church first hand, and have met many who are making the difference in the public square. Hartline's ""The Catholic Tide Continues to Turn"" would have been a much better book if he had focused more on the converging forces, those who are change-agents for the Church, and less on the ""resistant culture,"" secularists, and the attacks on the Church, particularly those that are centuries old. At times, I found this book to ramble and stray off topic.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book is loaded with detail and historical facts which will be useful to those who are less informed about the state of today's Church.",positive,1,2013-07-06,Health & Personal Care

B087CH6NBX,"Box is elegant but the ribbon is a disgrace and cannot be used This box is gorgeous and elegant and has diamond like etchings on it. It is also as sturdy as those colorful square boxes one can buy at Home Goods. The front flap magnetically closes. Since it is a beautiful silver, no wrapping is necessary. The only problem I have is that it comes with a bow that looks like it has been run over by a truck with black marks across it  in many places (see photos).<br /><br />To set this box up, all I had to do was unfold it. It is one piece and unfolds into the shape shown in less than a couple of seconds. There are no ugly creases; just a beautiful and sturdy box that can be used repeatedly for storage or for gifting. <br /><br />This particular version is the size of a small shoebox and will hold some lingerie or a small pair of PJs. The current price of $9.99 ($11.99 plus $2 off) is competitive. However, until they fix the problem with the supplied ribbon, I recommend passing on this.  ",neutral,1,2020-09-13,Health & Personal Care

We plugged one in underneath our sink where it smelled like mildew.

Of particular concern was that the outlet concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were 3.4 and 4.6 times the inlet concentrations, respectively. Both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are recognized as important indoor toxicants. Formaldehyde is classified as a human carcinogen.&quot;<br /><br />2015<br />Science Daily source Concordia University<br />&quot;Imagine if, in an effort to clean the air more efficiently, you were involuntarily introducing chemicals more dangerous than the ones you were trying to scrub. Concordia University researchers have found that this exact situation is happening with a type of air filter called photocatalytic oxidation (PCO), a product already on the market.

Then the tip of the intake tube broke off inside the pick!!!! All this was within the first 30 minutes of use! I'm returning this piece of junk.<br /><br />On the other aspects, the device is really clumsily designed and far too big. It is the size of a coffeemaker - for a water pick and a toothbrush!!! There is no need for the tank to be so big considering that they recommend that you unplug the pick from the tank when you use it to brush your teeth. And you must drain the tank when you unplug it since otherwise the water will leak everywhere! It is as if the people designing it did not even use it to see if the design made any sense.<br /><br />But perhaps one of the most annoying features is the poorly written instructions which seem to be a straight internet translation from the original Chinese. If the company could not even bother hiring a professional writer to at least convert this translation into something readable in English, then I don't see how it can be trusted to put out a quality product.<br /><br />All in all, I guess I am lucky that this crappy product broke in its first half hour of use and I can now return it. Given how flimsy the hose was, it could have broken off any time (and it is built in and thus not interchangeable!!!). Had it broken after the return period, I would have been screwed.<br /><br />Terrible product!",negative,1,2020-08-13,Health & Personal Care

B01D5CC1II,"Came with no label on the bottle. Big pill; however also only need to take one to get the max dose! Fish oil is one of nature's richest resources for Omega 3 and has been used to treat ADHD, arthritis, anxiety, cognitive decline, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, eye disorders, and immune compromises. Recently I went to a Psychopharmocology conference and the presenter discussed that Omega 3 had been shown in new research to provide protection against the depression, and in fact, may enhance many areas of brain functioning, including mood and personality. Individuals whom consume more Omega 3 have more gray matter volume in the areas of the brain important for regulating mood. How awesome is that! A supplement with efficacious research standing behind it saying that people whom take fish oil have less symptoms of depression! Fish oil has important benefits to both physical and mental health!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was not impressed with this bottle of fish oil when it arrived. It came in an unmarked bottle with NO LABEL that was readable on it. There were two small stickers on the bottle, overlapping one another; however none of the writing on the stickers was readable. I did not even know this was fish oil until I opened the bottle. As most fish oil products do, the pills had a fishy smell to them; however what matters the most is that you don't taste anything fishy or burp up the fish oil afterwards. While I didn't burp up this supplement or have any heartburn, the pill did have a slightly taste to it when I swallowed it-- not sure if it was lemon or fishy, however I did not like the taste. This would not stop me from taking the pills though. The pills were also quite big. I am able to take quite a few pills at once; however only one of these and still felt like it was a bit large to swallow. You do, however, only have to take one pill, whereas with all the other fish oil pills I bought, I had to take two. This pill is the max concentration of 2400mg, 860mg EPA, 430mg DHA. I also like the fact that the product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.

B09BBG25HT,"(5 1/2 month update) First time wearing heel protectors … failed at just over 2 miles [[VIDEOID:fceaf07df1742d003d474a09e5bd82af]] final update:  almost 5 1/2 months after first application.<br /><br />I must say that while I was disappointed that these heel protectors didn't 'glue on' the way I wanted to, I am more than pleased with the longevity of these protectors once they were applied.  While I did have to apply some 'touch-up' glue to the protectors a couple of times over the last few months, I did find that these protectors did the main job that were designed to do; that being protecting the heels of my shoes from wearing down as quickly as they would do otherwise.  What just happened here recently was that the upper front part of the shoe (where they bend around the toe-line) gave out before the heel protectors worn down to the point where the original heel of the shoe would starting impacting the ground.  Without these heel protectors in place, I believe (based on the miles I put on my shoes) that the heels on the shoes would have worn down to replacement level at least one or two months ago.  So, I do think these heel protectors work (though they do require some maintenance 'glueing') and am therefore giving the product a couple of extra stars.<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />update: 2 weeks after first review (see below) ... i completely removed the pads from the tennis/walking/running shoes and then reattached the pads to shoes using a more-than-generous amount of rubber cement (the type used to attach patches to a bike inner-tube).  Since that time i've put in excess of 30 miles on the shoes/pads and have had no issues.  to me, this indicates that this product --might-- be useful on non-rubber soles, leather for example, but isn't useful on rubber or rubber-like soles like the ones i have on all my tennis/walking/running shoes.<br /><br />Review of: Miiooan Invisible Shoe Heel Protectors<br /><br />I’ve found in my experience that the soles of my shoes, especially the heel portion of the bottom of the shoe, normally gives out far before the upper part of my shoes give out; and there have been many times I’ve had to buy a new pair of shoes even though the tops of the shoes were still in good condition.<br /><br />So, I was really hopeful that by adding these heel protectors I could get some ‘extra time/extra miles’ out of my walking shoes.<br /><br />What I found, however, was that the very first time I wore shoes with these heel protectors on was that the pads failed right around the 2-mile mark of my planned 6-mile walk on city streets/sidewalks.<br /><br />To prepare for the first walk, I carefully followed the instructions that came with the heel pads.  I used a brand-new pair of tennis shoes/sneakers/walking shoes that had never been worn before, I cleaned the bottom of the shoe (including using rubbing alcohol) and I firmly applied the heels to the bottom of each shoe and I waited 3 days before going on the walk.<br /><br />After only 2-miles, however, my right foot scrapped across a bit of sidewalk that was slightly raised on one side (by a tree next to the sidewalk) and the front part of the heel pad peeled back and away from the shoe.  And, since the glue was ‘hardened’ by that time, the flap of heel pad wouldn’t reattach to the shoe.<br /><br />What did happen, though, was that the loose flap of heel protector continued to grow to the point where, at right around 2 ½ miles, I had to rip the protector off the shoe just to be able to continue to walk safely down the sidewalk.<br /><br />And, when I got home and checked the heel protector on the other shoe, I saw that the heel protector on that shoe had also started to pull away from the shoe.<br /><br />The bottom-line for me is that, in what I consider to be a real-world test of the heel protectors just walking down a city street/city sidewalk, is that one protector failed completely and the second protector was on the verge of failing.<br /><br />This product, for me,  doesn’t come close to getting a passing grade.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click the Helpful button below",neutral,1,2021-08-30,Health & Personal Care

Our stomachs are supposed to have a very low ph (very acidic) to break down foods, absorb nutrients, and to kill off bacteria and viruses not supposed to be there.<br /><br />This is how I determined my dose: Start with one cap and work up slowly. When you feel heartburn, stop, and in your next high-protein meal, go back one dose. And remember your dose will vary depending on how much protein is in the meal. For instance, if I am eating a hamburger, I take 7 caps, but if I'm eating an apple, I don't take any.

I decided to try this because during allergy season, which for me is all summer through the end of fall, I tend to have a lot of protein deposits on my lenses and was only getting a weeks wear out of them instead of two weeks.

Had no problems using it, have my contacts soaking for 8 hours each night and never a bit of burning when I put them on.  And I know it says no need to rub your lenses but, yes, you very likely DO need to rub them clean.  Anybody with deposit issues needs to rub their lenses clean!  After taking them out of the solution in the morning they have a film on them, from the broken down protein deposits presumably.  A quick rub with saline and they are clear and ready to wear.

B07VMH452R,"fresh, mild to no taste, needs mixing in shaker cup or blender, I haven't been using this long, so far just once a day. I'm a little confused on dosing. There isn't any information regarding it on packaging other than add 1 scoop to your juice, smoothy or whatever. It says each scoop contains 3 grams of garcinia cambogia extract powder. Is that just weight, or is that the actual amount. Because.. that is 3000 mg of this extract otherwise-- which is higher than some other similar products out there. Maybe the serving size just happens to be larger where as the others are smaller with expectation to use it 2-3 times a day. This lack of clear info is frustrating. Hopefully other reviewers can comment on that.<br /><br />As for how it works. Well, I am not exactly sure what I am looking for it to do and how to measure my experience. I know it has been an ingredient used in weight loss formulations, and I sure could stand to lose several pounds, but I'm not sure about that for reviewing easily. Reading through some potential benefits like better digestion, better concentration, reduced food cravings, loss of appetite, reduced joint pain, improved cholesterol levels,  better mood, etc.. I figure the one I can measure best is the food cravings. I know what my habits are, and I will know if my desire for sugary foods reduces. So if I notice a reduction, then I can attribute it to this. So far, not feeling that, BUT it is early on and I have taken but one serving a day. I will give it a little more time and report back. Your desires for taking this as a supplement may vary from my own. There is no shortage of info on what this fruit is or its purported benefits are, as well as risks (such as do not take if have dementia or Alzheimer's) - so please read up. I know I am still learning.<br /><br />ACTUAL PRODUCT: So I will tell you more about the product itself. It is an 8 ounce bag of  garcinia cambogia extract powder. It is a resealable Mylar bag with a front window so you can see how much is in there. It comes with a small scoop, which is one serving. In my pic it shows the little scoop and the amount dumped into my hand. There are 76 servings in a container. If you plan to use it in liquid, plan to use a shaker cup or your blender. Just stirring it in will not work. I included a pic and you can see all the powder just sitting on top. Strangely, my spoon stayed dry. So that is when I got out the shaker cup and all blended fine with that.<br /><br />The taste is absent to me. Not sure if it supposed to have a noticeable flavor or not. The fruit is tart and I hadn't noticed a tart flavor with this. Maybe my taste buds are off. Seems that it will go well with yogurt, oatmeal, blended into smoothies, added to soups, broths, baked goods. I have been just consuming it with plain water or some organic lemonade in a shaker cup- because like I said, it doesn't mix by just stirring. The powder is fine, and not at all gritty. I'll likely add it into my next smoothy. I haven't tried it blended in with coffee- next time I will do that. I imagine if you like to fill your own capsules that this powder could work for that, but I don't know for sure.<br /><br />Everything about it seems fresh and of quality. I received it in 9/2019 and it has an expiration date of 3/2020; 6 months from now.  If I figure out anything else, I will be back to update. 3 stars because I need more time with product. Also I have no idea what the price is, and lack of info is concerning.",neutral,1,2019-09-16,

B071F4Z16T,"Tastes pretty decent and does a decent job replacing a meal here and there, but it's also kind of expensive. I'm surprised by this, but I actually kind of like the taste of Soylent. Normally I'll mix it with some unsweetened almond milk (although it's fine with good old H2O), and the taste is pretty good. It's hard to described, and similar to a lot of the other &#34;meal replacement&#34; products that I've used in the past, but it's kind of like soy milk with sweetness and a bit of grit. It works as a meal replacement, but is also a great product for fortifying (and thickening) smoothies as well.<br /><br />When using it as a &#34;meal replacement,&#34; something that I unfortunately seem to gravitate toward during busy workdays, it's a decent option. You're not really getting a whole lot of calories if you're going with the one-scoop serving (200 calories isn't replacing that much), it will get you through the day and does seem to stave off the pangs of hunger. I don't really want to drink much more than that, so in that capacity, it works pretty well for me.<br /><br />You'll definitely want to have a blender bottle at hand for mixing Soylent. The first time I tried it, I just tried mixing it in a glass with a fork (hoping that the tines would break up the powder sufficiently while I stirred), since I didn't have a whole lot of options at work. The results weren't that great, with lot of solid, gritty bits floating throughout (and stuck to the sides of the glass). Using a blender bottle gives much better results, and it's a good bit tastier when properly mixed.<br /><br />All-in-all, I do like the taste and versatility of Soylent, but for the servings you get out of this, it really is on the expensive side of things (although the pouches are apparently less expensive, which makes no sense).

B09XZ8VTPW,"Crazy Soft Right Out The Gate Disclosure: This was sent to me for free via the Vine program. I did not receive monetary compensation to write this review, just the product itself.<br /><br />I have a lot of shaving brushes. At this point, it's kind of a collection but in reality, I do actually use them. All of them, however, required a breaking-in period. Boar bristles are the worst offenders because the come smelling like a vaguely washed pig and take forever to break in to be soft. Badger bristles are usually fairly good but still need a breaking-in. To break-in a shave brush, you do what you'd normally do to soften and condition hair: wash it with soap. I soak mine in hot water for 12 hours to loosen any stray strands that would normally come out, then hit it with a puck of shave soap and lather it up hard, then leave the soap in for 24 hours, or more, depending. But I was absolutely astounded by this brush. It was shave ready right from the box.<br /><br />It's no mean feat to have something ""shave ready"" out of the box. I felt it and it was buttery smooth and perfectly worked in. I figured that it was a fluke and decided to do my standard break-in treatment. After the 12 hour hot water rinse, NO hairs came out. None. Not a single one. I figured ""okay, but once I lather this bad boy then it'll start to shed"". Nope. I hit it with a puck of soap so hard it could have turned the soap into diamonds...but no shed. Then, I left the soap in. I figured ""well, the soap will loosen the glue holding it in, that'll make it shed.""<br /><br />No. No it did not.<br /><br />This thing is ready to go right out the gate. I couldn't budge the badger hair knot to save my life. The handle it's attached to is gorgeous, also. It's large and provides a firm grip but is also light weight so you won't fatigue your hand. The brush, in overall size, is about 4-5"" so it's definitely no travel brush. But what it is is a thing of beauty. A soft, sturdy brush that you can take out of the box and get right to shaving with. Lathering it is a treat and it holds heat well. My only wish is that the handle wasn't varnished, to improve grip, but that's the only gripe I could come up with and even that's a stretch. This brush is perfect. Sure, you're gonna spend a bit on it. $50 for a non-brand-name brush IS a lot but by gosh does it perform equally or better than brushes in its category. And it has the dopest name ever. Who wouldn't want to shave with a brush named ""Professor Fuzzworthy""?!",positive,1,2022-06-16,Health & Personal Care

I tried both the strawberry lemonade and the blue raspberry.  I did not get a very strong flavor from either.  I enjoyed them mixed with another supplement I am using though.<br /><br />The downfall for me is the expiration.  Both say to use within 60 days after opening.  I personally do not love using the same flavor everyday.  I like the mix it up.  I use a few different ones at a time.  Unless you plan to only use this one and use it everyday, it will be expired before you finish it.  Most of the ones I have use a two year shelf life (some one year).<br /><br />This did mix well though with no clumping.  I just wanted more from the flavoring.

I found the formula to be highly effective in managing my symptoms: brain fog; malaise; joint/muscle pain; and peripheral neuropathy.  Starting approximately 6 months ago, I found it increasingly difficult to find the capsule formulation, so I decided to try the herbal powder formulation.  I was optimistic that it would be equally effective, or more so, than the capsules, but that has not been my experience.  Either the formula has been altered or the herbal variation has a reduced bio-availability in the body, but this product is simply ineffective.  I tried adjusting the dosages and changing the liquid media I'd mixed it in; thought that maybe I received a bad batch, but I've purchased and used three bags now and I've been thoroughly disappointed.

B00QFXVOL0,"A very good brush for a while. I’ve had to edit my review. I liked this brush, but after using it for a year it has started to shed its hair drastically. I have to clean hairs out of my shaving soap or mug after every use. It is shedding more than my old Everready brush that I used for years before I started electric shaving. I guess for the price, a year’s use isn’t bad, but I’ve reduced my rating from 5 stars to 3.  Going to try a more expensive brush,<br /><br />I guess. Over many years I've shaved with double edge blade, straight razor, rotating electric, reciprocating electric, the current crop of multi blade razors. I've shaved dry and wet, in the shower and out. I've used brush and soap, various canned or tubed lathers and creams and gels. And for years I wore a full face beard so I didn't have to shave so much.<br /><br />Recently, exploring razor reviews, I decided to go back to shaving with a double edged razor with soap and lather.  I couldn't find my last DE razor. Although I found my granddad's straight razor I used to shave with, I don't have the strop anymore.<br /><br />I bought a brand new Mercur DE razor and a bunch of blades. I found my Old Spice shaving mug and my old Ever Ready shaving brush. Using some Castile soap, I had the best shave I've had in years.<br /><br />Alas, my 60 year old Ever Ready brush started shedding badly. Back to Amazon to study shaving brushes.<br /><br />I settled on the Latherwhip Badger Hair shaving brush. I liked the reviews and the personal responses of the manufacturer to questions. As soon as I ordered the brush, I got email with advice on breaking in the brush, and using it. I think I'm too old to take any advice on how to use it, but I appreciate the thought. And I'm too impatient to take advice on breaking it in.<br /><br />Actually, the brush arrived in a soft enough condition to use immediately and there was no odor at all. I proceeded to lather up with it, out of the box.<br /><br />I've been using it for about a week now. It is very nice, and makes a great lather. There has been no shedding of the long bristles, but a couple of half length bristles came out on the second or third day.<br /><br />I like this brush, a very good brush for a reasonable price.",neutral,1,2016-12-07,Health & Personal Care

B0077L8YFI,"Really unimpressed The scale was really fussy to setup, and we setup hardware and networks for a living.  It was doable, but not very smooth for a consumer level product.  It is an expensive scale and they really should have done better than only supporting 802.11b.<br /><br />The initial setup turned out to be the best part.<br /><br />The scale does not appear to be very accurate.  In tests against 5 other scales, including a medical balance beam scale it is 5 out of 6 for proximity to the other scale's reading, and the adding of weight when holding a known quantity weight.<br /><br />It currently won't let anyone else get invites. Fitbit doesn't allow their support forums to be accessed by people who are not signed in, so an internet search did not turn up the problem.  Eventually I logged into the site and discovered that it is a known problem, but a couple of days later it isn't fixed.  Mainly the level of customer service is really disappointing.  They suggest submitting a trouble ticket for a workaround, but they are very slow to respond to trouble tickets.  Others are reporting responses to trouble tickets such as &#34;check you spam box&#34; when there is already supposed to be a known and acknowledged problem system wide where new invites cannot go out, yet clearly not all CS agents are properly informed.<br /><br />The scale has also randomly spammed the fitbit account with a dozen weigh-ins within the same minute, of a completely erroneous weight, which caused all kinds of incorrect badges to be issued, despite the whole &#34;matching&#34; via similar weight making it so that it should not ever think that one person has lost 25 lbs in a single day.<br /><br />The bodyfat reading appears to be based on a calculation of weight/height/sex which is sort of fine because none of the bioelectrical impedance scales really do an accurate job (although at least the ones with foot and hand sensors do (which this does not have) are a little more reliable.<br /><br />Not worth the money.

I thought it was going to be a wimpy stream, so that's good. There are two issues, though. Mainly, if you use the off switch on the handle while it's running, it leaks out of the bottom. It isn't the rubber seal on the reservoir, I checked. Depending on the pressure, it will either just drip or have a full stream coming out from the tube connection point. Secondly, I can't tell what the tongue cleaner is supposed to do.

B003KM3VMY,"Colonic Board and Matching bucket I wanted to get on here and write a full review because I was scared to death of this thing and had buyers remorse the second after I hit &#34;Submit order&#34;. I couldn't have been any more wrong in my life. I started reading the reviews and I will speak for myself. I thought the site said I would be emailed the directions once the order was placed. I wasn't so I contacted the seller (Raw Diet) and they wrote back immediately saying the instructions come in the box. Well I got the box today, used the board and bucket today. Here is what happened. First of all I am 5 feet 9 inches tall and I am 133 pounds (before doing this thing) The board was light. I can not say how light because I did not weigh it but if I had to guess I would say about 10 pounds. I had no issues at all lifting it what so ever. The bucket was even lighter. I made a few mistakes so I am going to cover them as well. Before I read the instructions I pulled the sleeve off the tube (I don't know why I did- but I did) It was a B!T@# to get back on, so don't do that. Secondly, My bathroom is not small and I had no problem with space. But if you have a small bathroom this may be an issue. Measure before you buy it. I used this vanity stool to put under the board and CLEARLY on the instructions it says use a chair a few inches higher then your commode. Well... That is for very good reason. Gravity is your friend when you are doing this. To lay flat means nothing moves in a natural motion (Down to the toilet) Once I got going, I felt water on my lower back. I immediately started gagging even though it was only water I had no idea what &#34;it &#34; was at that point and just the thought made me sick. Since it was my bathroom I had bath towels handy and I rolled four up and leaned to rectify this issue. I will definitely use a taller chair next time.  I filled the blue bucket up, and used only half the water because that was 45 minutes for me. I have had a professional colonic many times and it lasts about that long. So I knew what to expect. Even if there were not instructions this was possibly the easiest thing to figure out. Its one tube for Gods sake. Two ends of the tube.... its not rocket science at all. So reading the bad review that there were no instructions panicked me (seriously) and then I got it, DUH!<br /> Fill the water bucket with 98-99 degree water so you do not shock your system. Hook one end of the tube to the water bucket, stick the tube through the hole in the curved part of the board and then attach the plastic thingy (that is the medical term) to it and add lubrication to it and you are good to go. I got myself familiar with the water shut off plastic clip before I put water in it so I wouldn't have any weird mishaps. Worse then water being on my back :) I did do several courtesy flushes for myself because I am cool like that. When I was done, I jumped in the shower and cleaned it all up with bleach. Then I weighed myself. 128 HA. I did not buy it to loose weight at all. I bought it because my Mom just died of Liver cancer and I read more then I should ever have had too about how to prevent it. I am trying to stay on top of the health game that's all. I hope this helps.",positive,1,2015-08-04,Health & Personal Care

No matter how long I shake my blender bottle, I cannot get it to dissolve completely and the drink becomes very foamy almost instantly upon mixing.  I feel that I am loosing a decent amount of the powder as it will not dissolve completely and remains gritty.  The flavor is ok, it somewhat reminds me of the chocolates from advent calendars but maybe that's because I mix it with milk.

B01AINKGES,"Produspa Revolushine Styling Brush. I wish I could say that I am over the moon in love with this product and it solved all of my hair care problems. That obviously didn't happen, but it is still a good product so let's talk about all of the features.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It is a nicely weighted brush. It isn't super light, but I've used it several times and my arms never got tired the way they do with a blow dryer and round brush. Super plus.<br />2. The cord is nice and long and rotates 360 degrees which makes getting the back of your head much easier. I love this feature because sometimes I feel like I'm twisting into a pretzel to get the back of my head properly. Any help in that area is much appreciated! :)<br />3. There are ELEVEN different temperature settings! Wow! I really think this was super smart on ProduSpa's end because there are so many different hair types and needs and they all call for different temperatures to keep your hair at its best and healthiest. I also really like this because I've switched to a low heat temperature at the end and it helps make my hair nice and smooth and I love it.<br />4. There are little nibs at the end of the bristles that serve a dual purpose. The first and probably most important, they keep you from burning yourself. Hello, thank you for that. I am just about the clumsiest person ever and I have only felt too much heat one time on this product and it was because I was stupid and tried to touch it at the base of the bristles. Pro tip here: Don't touch it where the heat is  :)  But to brush's credit, I STILL did not burn myself like I would have if it was on a curling iron or flat iron. It hurt for maybe a second and there was no mark. I love that!<br />  The second reason these little nibs at the ends are great are because they massage your scalp! I love using this brush because it seriously feels amazing. I barely feel it when hairs get pulled out (because that always happens when you brush or comb your hair no matter what) and I'm sort of in a zen state for a few minutes as I just keep running it along my scalp. Between those comfortable nibs at the end of the bristles and the heat, I am in heaven.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I think my hair might be too thick for this to be the perfect straightening product for me. It works, it definitely works no question. But it takes longer to use this than my blow dryer and round brush. So if I have a few extra minutes I'll definitely pull it out because I love that scalp massaging aspect I spoke about above, but I don't always have a few extra minutes to do that. That being said, I'm going to try different techniques because I've wanted one of these straightening brushes for what feels like forever and I know all new styling tools take a while to master. Still though, I feel like a medium weight or thin hair would knock this out of the park right out of the box.<br />2. Because I haven't mastered this yet, I'm still pulling out my blow dryer and round brush to finish off styling the hair around my face. I work in a professional setting and I need to have everything perfect all the time. I just can't yet seem to achieve the look I'm going for with a flat heated brush. And if it dried my hair faster this wouldn't be an issue at all. But the fact of the matter is, it has been taking longer to dry my hair than just using my blow dryer and round brush. I'm going to try sectioning my hair differently to see if that helps and I will update this review.<br /><br />So to summarize, I think it is clear that I like a lot of things about this heated styling brush. There is a lot to like about this, and for someone else I'm sure it would work better. It just doesn't so much for me. What brings it down a few stars for me is that it takes way longer to dry my hair than the old way I was doing it and honestly, I am a very busy person and don't have extra time every day.<br /><br />There is something that I wanted to mention. I actually ordered the pink color and got the black. It in no way affect how I use this styling brush, nor does it really change my opinion of it at all. But it is still worth mentioning because when you order something, you want to get what you are expecting.<br /><br />I have to tell you that I received this at no cost or a discounted price for review, and testing. I was in no way compensated for a positive review, clearly. Every review I do is based 100% off of my experience with the product and I do not guarantee a positive review. In fact if you go and read all my reviews you will see that I give glowing reviews to the products I love regardless of if I received a discount when purchasing the product, and conversely I have given far less than glowing reviews when it was not a product I enjoyed.

My mouth was getting more sensitive to cold liquids and the taste in my mouth was worse than ever before. He said, ""Your mouth is totally healed.

B00WRPIB5W,"Love these gorgeous roller bottles for my furbuddy's hotspot medicine and my sore muscle remedy! I have a wonderfully adorable, but exceptionally dramatic, pup that I have the pleasure (ha) of catering to. Over the summer months he's prone to hotspots (itchy sore spots from bug bites or scratching or whatever) which isn't a huge problem except that our go-to hotspot medicine comes in a spray bottle and my little furbuddy thinks that the whiny sound of the spray bottle trigger means that Grizzoid the Puppy Slayer is not only in the room but mere seconds away from causing complete devastation. These Pure Acres Farm roller bottles have effectively banished the threat of Grizzoid the Puppy Slayer! I poured a bit of the medicine in a roller bottle and the little furmonster let me put his medicine on without having even a minor melt-down! The bottles are very well made and a gorgeous cobalt blue. Each bottle comes with its own screw on cap that closes tightly. The roller ball tops are separated when the bottles first arrive (making it really fast and easy to fill them), the top seats into the bottle then you press down to lock them in place. I used another of the bottles (there are six!) to mix an essential peppermint oil (that I love) with almond oil, then I use the roller bottle on sore or cramped muscles after biking (works like a charm!). I love how well the bottles work but I think what I'm most tickled about is how awesome they look: I'm really partial to this shade of blue and I love the way it looks on the shelf in my bathroom.

This is a new preservative free eye drop in a multi-dose bottle that holds over 220 drops, is designed for 7-symptom relief, will provide up to 12 hours of soothing comfort. Its makers say that the improved value and convenience of this bottle that delivers its contents in a new way, means that  these eye drops can be your first line of defense against  red, burning, itchy, dry, irritated, gritty or watery eyes.  The health aid’s bottle’s new proprietary technology includes a built-in purifying filter that keeps bacteria out so there is no need for preservatives. In addition, the aid is convenient and portable, can be carried in pocket or purse.<br /><br />Year round, I ordinarily use two eye care products daily: one to control allergic redness, itching in the eye, one to bathe it.

B07D754P47,"Not good for incontinence - Only for small drips and after going dribbles Fine for normal bladdered men and boys. They fit right inside tighty whiteys or boxer briefs. Very discrete as well. No one will notice you are wearing. But they are only for small drips and dribbles. Holds no more than 1/4 a cup at the most. Excellent though for after urinating when you think you got it all out and a small amount comes out after zipping up. Also good for typical guy stuff to keep that from going through underwear. But for bladder weakness, no unless you can stand the pain of holding it. Will not hold a whole accident at all even if your output is low due to a small bladder. Certainly not good at night for sleeping though maybe it can be  a booster pad inside a diaper at night at most. I tried these in the regular underwear briefs I have and I have wet spots in my pants every time and they leak and a few times small amounts ran down my leg. So for me these do not work. Gave them to a friend who has a normal bladder and for him they work well d=for that after bathroom drip",neutral,1,2021-10-19,Health & Personal Care

B007X07QUC,2-in-1 Dressing Stick with Shoehorn is Best I've Seen The 2-in-1 Dressing Stick & Shoehorn was an experiment to determine if my wife would benefit immediately from use as she is recovering from a broken shoulder. Unfortunately use required a higher level of dexterity than what she could muster. The shoehorn component was handy and she made good use of that.  (Note: Most competing models did not have this feature.)<br /><br />Shipping was not a problem as it came almost immediately. The stick was sufficiently sturdy and had 2 unique prongs/hooks so that a variety of tasks could be performed as specified on the web site and accompanying guide. Instructions were adequate for me to show her what she needed to do to help get dressed and undressed however her pain level and lack of freedom of muscle movement made it nearly unusable. I can use it however with my back issues.,positive,1,2014-11-17,Health & Personal Care

B01CKMP21W,Truck Driver on an off road. I work heavy highway construction driving a water truck off road on very rough dirt roads. This purple product is a game changer on the impact forces to my lower back. It's like having an additional air ride seat added to the air ride seat I already have in my big truck. The side to side forces we truck drivers take in the seat is what us truck drivers really get hit with a lot and with this purple product it does absorb them extremely well. I weigh 256lbs and not once have i bottomed this out and I'm talking about taking  hits so bad while driving at low speeds if I wasn't in my seat belt I would hit the ceiling in my truck or get thrown out of it.

But, if you have the case setting somewhere, you really need a handle to complete the effect of this little box looking like a miniature suitcase.

The sispention is so-so, you will feel the bumps and drops harder then you should with the use of the word sispention.<br />7. Well worth the money.<br />8. Best of all it’s a low profile scooter. Not flashy like the more exspencive models.<br />9. You need to charge it before you use it.<br />10. Not recamended for hilly locations.<br />11. Does not come with rear view Mirrors. (sold sepretly.<br />12. The EW20 does not seem to be set up to except the cute little “chalanger” Trailer.<br />13. Buy the long cable and a pad lock for it. (a must)<br />14. It would be wise to have head gear if you plan to go 15mph all the time.<br />15. If  you live in Florida. Watch out for the car’s when you in the crosswalk. They don’t care if your in it. They will zoom in front of you!  Meaning<br /> cars have the right of way. (idiots)<br />well that’s all for now.. updat: The EW20 is NOT a Sr. friendly.  It is very unstable. Thow a lot of fun Ride on. It is dangerous.  At top speed of 15 MPH + (free wheel)  you can easly tip it.  The center of gravity is way off. You need to cut the seata post to lower it low enough to fix it.  The women you see on it in the park? She is like 5ft tall or less.  It is not for tall people over 5’6” you knees will stick out. There is not enough leg/foot room for anyone taller.  It also should of never been madeTo be portable. It is way too big to put in a standerd trucnk. It is silly. Getting parts for it other that a battery or charger is non exsistent.  You have to call a qualified rediesterd rapair Co. to come out  (of no where) to fix it. The warenty does not cover labor or mods.<br />As an owner:  I’vve persnolized it a lot!  Took off the basket it blocks the tail lights and turn signals.  Was not made to pull the chalanger traier (it was discutinude) till further notice.  I had to add a 18”x 1” PVC pipe and a small hitch  ball on the seat post to hook it up. Put a breaklight under the seat. No turne signales.. remember this is a 48v scooter. The handlebar post comes loss do to flips and cubs and the likes. No mater how tight u put the breaket. Its going to have play in it.  I am not trying to put this  scooter to shame. It is A LOT of fun to ride on. Your insurance won’t pay for it. Do to its outdoorsy nature.  Its more for the young/mid lifeers.. and for us who have bad knees who can’t or just won’t want to walk that exstra mile to the stores or in my case a dialysis center.  Not for grass, not for dirt, gravel OR Rain.  You will just burn out the hub.<br />I hope this anwerd a lot of your Questions.  Bottom line I love the thing!

The handles adjust so I'm sure it would function well for people of various heights. Dad is 5'6"" & 112 lbs and it works well for him; a larger, heavier person might find the unit a bit flimsy especially after some use which is wherein the only issue I have with the unit arises. I have to check the assembly screws & re-tighten them every few days or the unit becomes quite wobbly. If not I fear the unit would eventually come apart & dump dad as he tries to raise himself. With that warning I recommend the unit; if the person using it is elderly or blind & unable to regularly tighten the assembly screws they may well be in for a nasty fall. Since dad lives with my wife & I and I can regularly tighten the unit it works for our purposes; were he living alone I would seek another solution.<br />For the price it is a decent, functional solution --just please be mindful of its' limitations before you buy.",neutral,0,2011-07-08,Health & Personal Care

She disappeared into her house and came out with a container 1/2 full of vital reds. She said you can have it. I started taking a scoop a day and ordered more. My triglycerides used to be 650 and caused me to get a stint. I started paying attention to the numbers. I’m presently on 3 meds for cholesterol. I could not get my triglicerides below 170 (150 is the max they should be). After 1 1/2 months of Vital Reds, my triglicerides went to 122. Amazing stuff. I was taking 2 BP pills/day as well. Now I take 1 BP pill and plan to drop 1 cholesterol med. I may drop another cholesterol med in 6 months if my number stay the same.",positive,1,2021-05-09,Health & Personal Care

B01N0AWW0R,"Started out 5 stars!!! Let me just START by saying, when I opened the box and first used this...I fell in LOVE with it! My hygienist said to me that my feet/gums had never been better!  I felt it was exactly what I was looking for, as were the results.<br /><br />Now, for the 2 star rating...the tip started leaking around the collar where it connects to the unit probably a month or so in.  What I quickly learned is that through just general use, I guess it works it's way loose...JUST enough to allow it to dribble all over me.  Not too big of a deal...just stop for a moment, grab the tip, and re-seat it by pushing in to the body.<br /><br />This no longer works...it leaks all the time...nothing prevents the leaking that I have found yet.  Unfortunately, after less than 6 months use, I am looking for anew unit.<br /><br />Truthfully, it is one of the lesser expensive options so, I didn't expect it to work flawlessly for 10 years but, certainly at least 1 to 3 years shouldn't be unreasonable.<br /><br />I have begun my search for a more reputable brand...I based my purchase originally on user reviews, and price point.  Might have been a mistake.<br /><br />*** UPDATE:  07.10.17<br />Upon posting my previous review, the seller IMMEDIATELY responded, and took full responsibility to not only reach out to me directly, but to also resolve the issue...a level of customer service I can't say I have seen very often.

Putting the color in is time consuming.  You have to wet the hair (but not too wet) and then run the chalks over the damp hair sections multiple times.  Wear gloves unless you like blue hands because it doesn't come off.  The other thing I have a problem with is it makes the hair very hard and you can't really brush it.  That may be user error on my part but it makes the hair stiff and crunchy feeling.  Some of my chalks were broken but they can still be used.

B00R0POB58,"Simple and effective--you control the pressure and it soothes muscles A few weeks ago, my calf muscle was feeling really tight. I did multiple stretches and held the stretches for minutes at a time. I massaged my calf with my hands, but I couldn't get the tight feeling to go away. A couple hours after trying to stretch that feeling out-- I ripped my calf muscle when I went to jump. So I looked into what I could have done to prevent that and a muscle roller stick was recommended. I bought this muscle roller stick to help specifically with my calf muscles, and it has worked like a charm. After working out, I roll my calf muscles and that releases the tight feeling. Since using this roller stick, I have not had any problems with my calves and I can always get relief from the tightness. I also like using this roller stick on my whole body. It feels nice on my thighs after working out and my back after a long day. It is a very simple product, but it works better than I thought it would. The roller stick is a great way to massage yourself and you can adjust the pressure to your liking. I am very happy with this product.

Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One BP unit<br /><br />- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet<br /><br />- One large cuff<br /><br />- One cloth carry pouch<br /><br />- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA Batteries<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.<br /><br />- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.<br /><br />- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.<br /><br />- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.<br /><br />- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese. <br /><br />- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.<br /><br />- The display is large.<br /><br />- Accuracy is within range of my gold standard monitors.<br /><br />- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator. What happens is that after three readings, the first number displayed is the average. The next three numbers and beyond are the readings. Once I cycle through all the readings, the average is never displayed again unless I turn off the unit and then press the memory button again.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed. <br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.<br /><br />For those who are interested, I attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5-star monitors. These monitors I consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others I tested. I listed two 4-star monitors because they have unique features such as Spanish speaking or Bluetooth. Each one of these monitors is accurate and I would highly recommend any of them.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. It does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. The arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00UB5EXNE A&D Wrist BP Monitor Model UB-543]] – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on. Accuracy is spot on, which is atypical of wrist monitors. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01AFQK85K HealthSmart Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor.

The LCD Display is medium but easy to read and color coded in green, yellow, and red based on the hypertension level—which is EXCELLENT. There are two power options. It takes four AAA batteries or a USB Type C cable (both are included). There is an average feature after two readings. There are date or time settings in AM/PM (not military time). The cuff size is large. There is an irregular heartbeat indicator. Accuracy is spot on. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09WGYJRH8 Checkme Arm Cuff Only Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor for iOS or Android Model BP2A 4663]] – This is one unique monitor. The monitor and cuff are in one unit and this is most useful if paired with the iOS or Android app (viHealth). The cuff size is large but the display on the cuff is small. Operation is simple. This is rechargeable and comes with the USB Type C cable for charging. There is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app. There is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app. In fact, the readings can be associated with multiple users (number and amount unknown). The date and time are automated through the Bluetooth pairing with the app. As of June 2022, the app is quirky and does not always connect. The BP unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone.

B00KCD7ZBM,"Not bad as a somewhat more nutricious alternative to cookies or candy, but these are still a bit too sweet for my taste I've been eating Zone bars, here and there, on occasion, for a long time. I read Barry Sears book on the Zone, which was one of the earlier popular dieting books to suggest that a good diet should be neither &#34;low-fat&#34; nor &#34;low-carb&#34; but should deliver a good balance of fat, carbs and protein, and that eating foods with the proper balance would give you more energy (or put you in &#34;the Zone&#34;). That was a long time ago, and I've forgotten the specifics, but for a while I would buy Zone bars (or Balance bars, which seem to be designed on the same principle) as an alternative to, say, candy bars. I still do that sometimes.<br /><br />I've purchased the ZonePerfect Kidz bars occasionally as snacks for my kids lunches. They're a bit more like candy bars -- sweeter, with more sugar -- than the &#34;adult&#34; zone bars, but it's better than buying cookies. I hadn't tried the Fudge Brownie kind before, and I have to say I'm not a huge fan. It's a bit too sweet, and the taste isn't really to my liking. My kids will eat them, but don't love them either, so while I do expect to buy other flavors, I don't think I'll get this one again.<br /><br />Having said that, this is good deal, and buying them in these 30 count packages saves money over buying the single boxes in the local grocery store, unless they happen to be on sale. When you buy these, there's a generic cardboard box with 6 of the 5 count boxes inside of it.",neutral,1,2014-10-14,Health & Personal Care

B00118033O,"LOVE! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I had weight loss surgery and needed to find a protein supplement for after the procedure.  I am very picky about my protein drinks because they're all so nasty!!  Protein powder was a struggle - everything had terrible texture or flavor.  I wasn't sure if I should take a gamble on this powder, being that it is kind of pricey, and I've hated every protein powder I've tried thus far.  I bought it, I drank it, and it was pretty good!  I even took those flavored water packets, that you put in a bottle of water shake - I mixed that into my protein water as well or even a shot or two of lemon juice - it made it even better!  Now I can drink it with out without a flavor packet and it's the best protein powder I've tried yet.<br /><br />HOWEVER - what I've learned about the whey protein isolate is that IT NEEDS TO SET.  It doesn't dissolve instantly, like stated.  I've found that if you put some water in the bottle first, then add half the scoop and shake the bottle a bit..it'll start dissolving faster - then add more water and the rest of the scoop then SHAKE THE HELL OUT OF IT for a minute or so.  Some people can drink it after that, but the little pieces of undissolved powder gross me out.  So, I let the bottle sit for a few.. I go find something do to then come back to it.  Giving it a shake if I happen to walk by it.  Then after a few minutes it is fully dissolved and there are no powdery pieces.

I didn’t have the time that i needed to do a real wax job, and also wanted something that would last longer. I checked on a real ceramic coating and that was going to be $1800. I ran this the car through an automatic car wash, blew the excess water off with compressed air, and did 1 dry application. Huge difference. You can feel it just touching the paint or grabbing the door handle. So far i have run it through a power car wash 4 times since the application; to the touch, it still feels about 80% as slick and water beads amazingly. Hydrosilex says you can build up the coating with multiple applications, so I intend to do it 3-4 more times, and estimate I’ll need about 45oz in total to due it based on the first application.

B0861ZXZQL,"A Good TENS Machine Choice This POHAKU Dual Channel TENS Muscle Stimulator arrived with the tiny control unit almost fully charged. The USB charger and cable, the electrode pads and wires, as well as a drawstring carrying bag, were all in a box that seemed too small to hold it all, but did.<br /><br />This unit applies strong electrical impulses to the body, so I RTFM’ed before I tried it. The User Manual is relatively well translated from Chinese; it’s a treat from the norm of literally translated manuals that make no sense at all. It covers the unit’s features, safety precautions, operation, care and maintenance (plus info on TENS theory and techniques and some troubleshooting steps), and complements the largely self-explanatory control unit screen and buttons. Several tiny drawings show where the electrodes go on the body for various purposes; you’ll have to experiment to find the right configuration and the most effective of the 24 operating modes.<br /><br />After reading the User Manual, I plugged in the wires, stuck two of the incredibly sticky pads to my arm and turned the unit on. The startup impulse intensity is zero, so I used the control button to ramp it up, and—wow!<br /><br />The strength of the impulses even at about half intensity, which is as far as I went in my test, was impressive. I expected to not feel much, but I was wrong. This little thing packs a big punch!<br /><br />My long-standing doubts about “fad” health treatments tempered my initial positive reaction to this device, which I tested just enough to write this review. It works very well, but only time will tell if it’ll really relieve aches and pains, none of which I happened to have at the time. If you’re into electrical muscle stimulation as an alternative health treatment, this thoughtfully designed, high-quality powerhouse puts out more than enough juice to do the job.

B07VCHQCMM,"It works perfectly This pump works much better than expected.  I don't need this medically, but the added width created by this device is excellent.  With the red and black seals, I recommend placing them first in oneself and then placing the tube, since even with lubrication they may be tight (which is desirable for greater suction).  It can work without a seal but it works best with one.  The lower setting creates a large amount of suction, so it only progresses to greater suction when ready.  Use it as instructed or recommended by your doctor.<br /><br />  Cons:<br />  - Be sure to open the ""mouth"" accessory first and wash it thoroughly, as it is covered with dust that adheres to everything.<br />  - The motor section is not waterproof.<br />  - The frame is larger than expected (which is also a professional because the device can accommodate many input sizes)",positive,1,2019-10-10,Health & Personal Care

B0153XDFCS,"Best shaker bottle I have used for its size The cyclone cup arrived on time and in great condition. I like the design of the bottle especially the detachable shaker part attached to the cap; it makes it really easy to clean which is really important for protein drinks and smoothies.<br />Every morning I make a meal replacement drink (Amazing Meals Vanilla Chai)  and a fruit and veggie smoothie with my Nutribullet. I originally bought this to store my meal replacement drink to drink it for lunch, but since I put pureed pumpkin and ground oatmeal in addition to the meal replacement powder, no amount of shaking would make it as smooth as I needed it to be (aka Nutribullet smooth). So I switched up my routine to have my meal replacement as breakfast and the fruit and veggie smoothie I now drink throughout the day as a snack to keep me going until dinner. I put the fruit and veggie smoothie into my cyclone cup. It usually separates within an hour with the roughage floating to the top. A couple good shakes in this bottle and everything is all smooth again. I did use the cyclone cup when I made a mini meal replacement with just the meal replacement powder and milk and the cyclone cup blended it up perfectly. It was as smooth as could be expected with that type of grainy meal replacement. The only other shaker bottle I have used was the blender bottle and I like this one much better except that the cyclone cup is a bit small.<br />The cyclone cup comes with a detachable bottom cup like container. I originally put my protein powder in there and put the milk in the bottle to keep it separated until I was ready to drink it because I find that this meal replacement gets thicker as it sits. When I unscrewed the bottom compartment it was a MESS. There was powder everywhere at my desk, but honestly it was to be expected just by looking at it, so that was mostly my fault. The next day I tried to just put some of my supplements and vitamin pills in it, but every time I shook the bottle it was like playing maracas and I got some annoyed glances from some of my co-workers :) I have now just completely detached the bottom part and travel with just the bottle which is okay because its smaller size fits in a lot more places.

There are a few problems that I have had to work around to make sure this product doesn't just end up in landfill two days after its arrival in the mail.<br /><br />First off, the center of the clip cracked when I clipped it onto the bar of the commode. I didn't apply any extra pressure, it's simply designed poorly. The clip itself is still intact and holds onto the bar no problem. The fact that upon it's first use it broke in some way is pretty disappointing though.<br /><br />Another annoyance with the design is that it pivots around the bar of the commode a lot or simply falls off. I fixed this by wrapping a strong rubber band around it so that it stays more or less in place without falling with use.  If it had a metal clip that wraps around the bar with rubber grips this would solve the problem. Since it is made of plastic it is useless without the rubber band around it.<br /><br />The largest annoyance is that there is no end that prevents the toilet paper roll from slipping off with use. Whenever my mother pulled toilet paper while using the restroom the whole roll would fall off but the toilet paper holder (with the a more than a little help from the rubber band) stays on. To fix this I repurposed a platic lid from a small oatmeal box and cut a tight-fitting hole just big enough to fit over the end.<br /><br />I'll update this review with pictures later.<br /><br />Had I not been so determined to not let my money go to waste, this product would be in the trash right now and it would be receiving a one star review. Since I somehow made it work I'm giving it two stars.<br /><br />If you buy this product be prepared to be extremely disappointed with how useless it will turn out to be... unless you make these modications.",negative,1,2015-12-16,Health & Personal Care

Considering the relatively high price for curcumin, I would like there to be a more noticeable benefit.<br /><br />I measure two pills having 1330 mg of powder in them, which is close to what I expect from the claimed 1310mg of ingredients. It means these capsules have minimal to no fillers, which is what they advertise.<br /><br />You are after the curcumin, not the turmeric, so the 100mg of turmeric extract is the important number when price comparing. The current price is $13 for 90 pills, which $1.44/gram. The 90-pill bottle is $0.94/gram. The NOW brand 60 pill bottle costs $0.33/gram. The Doctor’s best 120 pill bottle is $0.34/gram. Nothing about this B’LEAF NATURE curcumin would suggest that it is a better product that is worth such a price premium over the established reputable brands.<br /><br />You can buy tumeric root at the grocery store if that is what you want. Tumeric is too bulky relative to the active compounds for it to be a good supplement. Instead, focus on supplements that contain just the curcumin extract, and ones that contain more of the desired extract than what is in this pill.<br /><br />Made in the USA in GMP certified facility.",negative,1,2021-04-03,Health & Personal Care

I've read a lot about them and sour cherry reduces inflammation and muscle soreness, helps with insomnia, and prevents gout (a form of arthritis).  Inflammation is my middle name so I wanted to try this. Although, I don't have gout, I do have arthritis in various parts of my body. I also have daily muscle aches and inflammation (which was recently verified by a doctor), yet after consuming these capsules for a couple of weeks, they have had no effect either good or bad on me. I should be finished with the bottle in another two weeks.  The positive is that I did not have any side effects.  I've used Nature's Bounty red yeast rice and although that product worked for me to lower my cholesterol, I had a permanent nasty side effect from it. Therefore, I consider the absence of any bad effects with this supplement a big plus. On the other hand, I've had no reduction in soreness or inflammation so it's like taking a placebo for me.  It does appear this tart cherry concentrate works for some, so I suggest anyone considering this give it a try.<br /><br />Depending on how many pills are taken per day, this bottle provides a 60, 30, or 20 day supply. The recommended dosage is 1 to 3 pills per day with meals. The max I've taken was 2 per day.<br /><br />I called Nature's Bounty to understand why the bottle says 1000mg equivalent on the front, yet the back says 250mg per capsule. What the fellow say to me was that the powder is concentrated and the 250 is the weight if you were to empty the contents of the capsule. However, he said since it is an extract, these compressed components are equivalent to 1000mg per capsule. Whether this is really true or not, I have no idea.<br /><br />As for the ingredients, besides the tart cherry (prunus cerasus) fruit extract, each capsule also includes vegetable cellulose and less than 2% of silica and vegetable magnesium stearate.

I hold the spoon up to my face, grimace, and shove it in my mouth. I then ferociously chug my water, while letting out a carnal grunt.<br /><br />I tried mixing it with my pre-workout drink. Wrong move.

B00BYG3OWK,"Unexpected jarring blue light at bedtime, but otherwise effective. If you can follow the instructions. Good: this light wakes me up gently and within a few minutes of the beginning of its sunrise mode.<br /><br />Bad: I have become adept at turning off yet another form of alarm in my sleep, and this one isn't unpleasant enough to wake me up sufficiently that I remain awake for long.<br /><br />Most jarring thing: the sunset simulator goes from full daylight and fades over a half-hour. This sounds great. In practice, this means if you are using the lamp on automatic light temperature cycle mode and initiate sunset after 9pm (when the lamp switches to &#34;night&#34; warm-white mode), there's a slight delay, and then all six LEDs turn on full blast. That means a jump in illumination and a strong shot of blue light, although the ramp-down of the light is nice and smooth and helps me go to sleep a little more quickly than I otherwise might. Minus one star.<br /><br />The people who complain about the user interface are not wrong. It's amazing, and I say that with astonishment and fear. The icons are tiny. You do need the manual. This would be minus two stars on its own. There were some details in the manual that were slightly inaccurate (exact button sequences to save/escape), but I managed to puzzle through with some trial and error and button-mashing.<br /><br />You can tell that you have the feature enabled if the relevant icon is blinking. If the icon isn't blinking, go back through and try again.<br /><br />If you want to test the light alarm to see how it turns on, don't set the alarm for 1 minute from now, set it for 31+ minutes from now. It's not programmed to realize that a newly set light alarm less than 30 minutes away should turn the light on immediately and bring it quickly to full intensity, it will only activate at the 30 minutes before alarm time mark.<br /><br />The lamp will shut itself off after a while when it's turned on as an alarm.",neutral,0,2017-01-29,Health & Personal Care
B007FGLTXE,"Keeps mouth shut but can't get comfortable I haven't made up my mind about this product. It does a great job of keeping my mouth shut, but I struggle to get it adjusted just right.<br /><br />The first night or two, the front slipped down over my eye brows. I could pull it back, but this would wake me up, etc. Also, the side edge of the cap rubbed along my ears, which was irritating. I folded the front and side edge up inside the cap and fastened it with masking tape. Worked fine for a week until I noticed that the glue on the tape had melted and slimed the cap and my head. I finally got the glue off, but I frankly don't recommend this method. No. Not at all.<br /><br />In the midst of all this, I used four safety pins along the top of the cap from front to back to take up some of the fabric so that the sides wouldn't rub my ears. It worked, but it felt like I had lost some stability and that the cap was getting to be more like a piece of fabric strapped to the top of my head than a cap. I removed them when I de-slimed the cap just so I could start over with a &#34;clean&#34; cap.<br /><br />And then there are the side straps. Like the bottom cap edge, the back edge of the straps rubbed my ears. If I repositioned them forward, they would pull the cap down in front (see above). Still, the loop patch on the straps barely overlapped the hook patch on the cap. It held, but perhaps the patch on the cap should extend further back.<br /><br />The hook patches being so far forward might indicate that I need a larger size (is there one?) so that they would be further back and match up with the loop patch on the straps; however, the cap sides being so low indicates that maybe I need a smaller cap. I'll probably try wearing it again, but I my home-made chin strap, although not perfect, works better.",neutral,1,2015-11-27,Health & Personal Care

B00KTEZVI8,"It's ok... I bought the 6 oz bottle as a supplement for my elderly cat that has had a few UTIs due to kidney disease. I can't really say whether or not this product works bc I don't have any way to actually test to see if it's doing what it says it does, but it doesn't seem to be giving her any negative side effects, so I'll continue to try it. I will say that I've added it to my water a few times and it doesn't have a taste or smell. The powder is the same consistency as powdered sugar and it just melts in liquids without leaving clumps or gritty residue behind. I haven't had a problem with my cat refusing to eat her wet food when I've mixed the powder into it. I'm not sure if she isn't detecting it or just doesn't mind it being there, but either way, she eats and that's a good thing.<br /><br />I don't like the packaging. It's extremely wasteful.

B003Y68KWW,"These are fantastic gloves for hunting or even skiing, but undersized Huge thumbs up.  I had owned two pair of these prior to this pair, purchased from Academy - one ""medium"" and one ""large"". I lost one of the large ones while hunting, which had fit me but rather tightly, and the pair of mediums was too small - gave them away.  So I ordered these extra large, and they're perfect, and only slightly on the large size for my medium-sized hands.  So like most gloves, and most clothes for that matter, they're not correctly sized (for ya know, human beings - well, Asians maybe).  So if you have small hands, order medium or large, medium hands, order large or x-large, large hands, order x-large, and XL hands - you're screwed.  Postive:  These ARE waterproof, or just nearly so - very close to being waterproof, despite being of a soft & quiet material (for hunting).  You can put your keys or a chemical warmer or whatever in the back zippered pouch - BUT when a warmer goes in there, it's much closer to the surface than to your hands, with the main insulation being between it and your hands, so I don't think it will work well at all - but not to fear - do what I've done several times with these - just shove your chemical warmer up into the mitten part with your fingers, and they work in there, and won't fall out when you flop them open to shoot, etc.  Or I suppose you could put one warmer in the mitten top with your fingers, and one more in the back for good measure, if you're down under 0 F or some such. I've used these with a release/bow, and rifle both.  I will be skiing with them in April of these year, but as mentioned, already tested them for watertightness, so I'm confident. Coupled with a capacitive  stylus pen, I can read books, etc. on my iphone/ipad or android when hunting/fishing.  In fact, that's precisely the best use for that zippered pouch - your collapsible capacitive stylus.  You can cut the thin glove fingers off to use your fingers for a touch screen or to have more feel for a minute task, or you can leave the fingers as is.  I leave them.  This XL is *perfect* for medium hands like mine because there is still room in the fingers to put a thin glove underneath, like a winter golf glove.  If you have large hands and get an XL, or have medium hands and get an L, AND you want to wear a thin glove underneath, you're gonna need to cut the fingers off.  Good hunting.",positive,1,2012-02-18,Health & Personal Care

This has to be the best for SUPER COMPACT mini travel water flosser.<br />Wish the hose would be in metal (coil pring) material instead of rubber/silicone material because it would dry or air out must easier.<br />Water reservoir is very tiny, so if you are looking for large reservoir or lazy to refill multiple times then this flosser isn't for you .<br />But for those who love conceal, tiny and portable easy to fit in small/wristlet/clutch purses this IS THE ONE!<br />Price $15 it's reasonable!",positive,0,2023-05-22,Health & Personal Care

B09VSWJ9SG,"2 users/90 readings each; large cuff/display; two power options included; accuracy on low side [[VIDEOID:579d94ad1af6e4875028086757c7cc69]] This is the 31st BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy errs on the lower side by a few points but is still within an acceptable range. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One BP unit<br /><br />- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet<br /><br />- One large cuff<br /><br />- One carry pouch<br /><br />- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA Batteries<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.<br /><br />- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.<br /><br />- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.<br /><br />- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.<br /><br />- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.<br /><br />- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.<br /><br />- The display is large.<br /><br />- Accuracy is ERRs on the side of the low range compared to my gold standard monitors but is still acceptable.<br /><br />- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- The date and time settings are NOT remembered after the power is removed but the BP numbers are remembered  -- I tested after one minute of battery removal.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />- It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The accuracy is off by several points on the low side compared to my 5-star monitors.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed. The big negative is that the accuracy is not as precise as my god standard monitors but is still within range, and the cuff is thin.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. There's an irregular heartbeat indicator.  The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.<br /><br />For those who are interested, I attached some notes about the other monitors I have tried.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors and one I purchased a few months ago on Amazon. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. Unfortunately, it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. I love the arm cuffs on this monitor because one size fits most.  (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00UB5EXNE A&D Wrist BP Monitor]] – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated only. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01AFQK85K HealthSmart Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor. (4 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B07G3P5C1M Choice Basic Upper Arm BP monitor]] –  Super basic. Only stores 15 numbers in memory for one user without any date and time. There’s no case and it is battery operated only. (3 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B07G3D6BVG Choice Basic Multi-User Upper Arm BP monitor]] – This is good if storage for 4 family members is needed. It comes with a carrying case and it is battery operated only. (4 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B085VN5DQB Miecux Digital Upper Arm Monitor]] – The monitor is for 2 users w/99 readings each.

(3 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B08GCPJ8C1 XUMAO Digital Upper Arm Monitor]] - The monitor is for 2 users w/99 readings each. There’s also an alarm feature.

(3.5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B08BC1DXHF 1by one Digital Upper Arm BP Monitor]] - This is a decent monitor with a large cuff so larger individuals can use it. It is only battery operated via 4 AAA batteries and only has one user mode with 99 memory points. The biggest negative is the European date and time. (3.5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B08HK71G16 Teyiyes Digital Upper Arm BP Monitor]] -This is a great monitor with a large cuff, two power sources (4 AAA batteries or A/C cable), and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each. (4.5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B08DTWKYC9 Etekcity Digital Bluetooth Upper Arm BP Monitor]] - The monitor is for 2 users w/90 readings each. It has a large cuff and two power sources (4 AAA batteries or A/C cable). The drawbacks are that I could not get the monitor to pair with the app with Bluetooth on and the angle of the display makes it difficult to read unless it is tilted back. Also, the time is only displayed as a 24-hour clock. (3 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B08KXWKDDM A ANJOCARE Upper Arm BP Monitor]] - The monitor is for 2 users w/250 readings each. It has a large cuff with a cord that is just a tad shorter than other monitors I tried. There is one power source included (4 AAA batteries). There is also a connection for A/C cord but that must be purchased separately. The LCD Display is large and easy to read. (4 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B08NT3QPMM KIUZOU Wrist BP Monitor]] – This monitor has two user modes w/99 readings per user. The cuff is large, so most people will be able to use this. Two AAA batteries are the only power option. There is a speech option which is set by default. Time setting is military time only. (3 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B081HCZPY2 Vive Precision Upper Arm Smart BP Monitor]] – This monitor has four user modes w/240 readings per user. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by four AA batteries or A/C adapter – both supplied. It has a seven-day AM/PM average feature in addition to the regular average feature. Smart app does not work and keeps crashing. (3 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B091CKDZ9R Asobilor Large Display Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This monitor has two user modes with 90 readings per user.

The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by the two included AAA batteries. The LED is large and the unit is simple to use and operate. Unfortunately, the BP is actually 20 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure) mostly due to the unit/cuff design that does not allow for a secure fit.  The respiration number is accurate, however.  (2 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09DPPF2ZD URBEST Large Display Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This monitor has two user modes with 90 readings per user. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by four AAA batteries (included) or included USB cable (no A/C adapter). The display is large for easy reading. Time is in military time only (24-hour clock). The cuff inflation is so strong that this is the most uncomfortable monitor I ever tried. It caused my arm to go numb and left a mark and pain for hours. (2 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09JYND7QX Aleshon Store Electronic Wrist BP Monitor with Voice]] - This monitor has two user modes with 99 readings per user. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by two AAA batteries, NOT INCLUDED. The LED is large and the unit is simple to use and operate. There’s also a voice assist option. Unfortunately, the BP is around 10 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure). The closer the user holds the arm to heart level, the less the inaccuracy but it is still not as good as the gold standard.  The respiration number is accurate, however. (2 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0995WJ42M Huuloo Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This monitor has two user modes with 120 readings per user. This monitor is very basic as it does not have an average or irregular heartbeat feature. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone.

The LCD Display is large and easy to read. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock only (a.k.a. military time). The biggest negative is that it does NOT have an AVERAGE feature for the BP readings like other monitors do.

The LCD Display is large but sometimes not easy to read due to the haze of other numbers. Time settings are available in 12 or 24-hour clock. The numbers are AVERAGED after two reads. BP takes a long time to register, so this is not a fast reader. Voice option is available. (3 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09KXD6SNP Femometer Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor]] - This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. There is one very large cuff provided so most people will be able to use this. There are two power options supplied, either via a Type C USB cable (included) or via four AAA batteries (included).

The numbers are averaged after three BP and it has an irregular heartbeat indicator. (4.5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09N92DMSH Difini Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor]] – This wrist monitor is cheap junk. It holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. It has a large display and takes two AAA batteries NOT included. There is an average feature and irregular heartbeat indicator. The manual is incomplete. Accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors and this monitor would have received 4 stars had it not been for the cheap faceplate which falls off repeatedly because it is only taped on.

B0002HS7OW,"Update:  Great side effect: No more snoring! Update to my review from 2009:<br />I have found the same product for much cheaper at my local Costco: a bottle of Kirkland ""Mucus Relief Chest Guaifenesin 400 mg, 200 tablets"" for $11.55 ($0.06/400 mg tablet) instead of this ProHealth product of 100 tablets for ~$20 ($0.20/400 mg tablet). The ProHealth is over 3 times the price!  And the Kirkland brand tablets are MUCH easier to swallow.<br /><br />The price at my local Costco is currently cheaper, btw, than buying the same Kirkland bottle on amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Expectorant-Guaifenesin-Immediate-Release/dp/B002RL8FIE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1291354212&sr=1-1)<br /><br />======================<br /><br />First, my product review<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Eliminates my snoring! (see below, your mileage will vary)<br />- The least expensive product (per mg) that I have found so far.<br />- Shipping has been reliable from this vendor.<br />- Product is 100% guaifenesin (no decongestent, etc..)<br /><br />Cons<br />- As previously posted by another reviewer, they can be difficult to swallow because of their size and the fact they are not coated. I have a large mouth :)  so not so much a problem for me, but those with smaller mouths/throats (like my wife) might have more difficulty.<br /><br />I have been taking Guaifenesin for the last 5+ years. My allergy doctor recommends taking it when I first notice allergy or cold symptoms as a means to help me combat the allergy/cold and recuperate faster.<br /><br />I used to snore often and thought I had sleep apnea (I don't, according to an overnight sleep study). My wife and I were both sleeping poorly from my snoring and our quality of life was greatly impacted.  She made this (life-saving!) observation that I did not snore when I was on the guaifenesin when I was taking it for cold/allergy symptoms.<br /><br />Given how guaifenesin is rated as a relatively safe drug, my allergy doctor saw no harm in taking it regularly and told me that, although it is not advertised to help address snoring, he could see how thinning the mucus (that I often have) would make breathing through my air passage easier and reduce the snoring.<br /><br />Guaifenesin might not help your snoring at all, but I would certainly recommend that you talk to your doctor if you have a snoring problem and ask if it makes sense to try it.<br /><br />Pierre",neutral,1,2009-08-10,Health & Personal Care

BUT it irks me that 1. the flavors are not printed on the straws so you don't know for sure what you are getting. 2. that there's always more of the least liked flavor in the bunch.  Mainly you can't tell if you are getting Birthday cake or Unicorn.....I am assuming the other flavor colors are obvious, but not sure.  My bad, I wanted the grandkids to taste a variety and pick favorites so I could order specific flavors.

So that little plug is actually for the ""tool"" that goes in there. That plug won't stay, but that's not a deal breaker. I fully charged this water pick and it has very little force.

B00TJ15OV6,"Saffron, Be Natural. I knew about this product by chance as I was looking for Spanish and/or Persian saffron to use with my coffee and some kinds of food recipes. Honestly, I started searching about health facts of saffron extract medicine just after knowing about and receiving this product. I found myself immersed in reading and searching about new topics almost everyday. What really fascinated me about this product at first is the health benefits of saffron, which I am in dire need for. Saffron can be beneficial for mood disorders and depression, many studies state so. In my review, I will first surface the available info about saffron's extract; then, I will extract the main conclusions from credible research papers.<br /><br />I have reviewed research papers and summarized the main points about and benefits of saffron's extract for a reason. Besides sharing what found amazon readers, I needed to know more about saffron's extract and its benefits to health since it might be the perfect natural choice to treat the symptoms of depression that I have been suffering from in the past several months. And, I wanted to know if there are certain things that I need to be aware of when purchasing a product of saffron's extract.<br /><br />Anyhow, I've read some information about saffron extract that discuss the growth of scientific evidence in which saffron's extract provides several health benefits including weight loss and treating depression. The study states,<br /><br />  Saffron is best known as a weight loss aid because it reduces your appetite and the craving for a lot of food,<br />  and it works by increasing the serotonin level in your brain. Serotonin is the chemical in your brain<br />  responsible for regulating mood and eating, so by increasing the chemical level, you’ll no longer feel the urge<br />  to overeat (Aleo Nutrition, n.d.)<br /><br />According to a study that was accomplished in 2010 where a large group of 60 overweight women &#34;took a saffron supplement every day for eight weeks, while another group took only placebo, also for eight weeks. During the test period both groups’ calorie intake were not regulated, but at the end of the period, those who took the saffron extract lost more weight and found their urge to snack had been reduced&#34; (ibid)<br /><br />Saffron's extract  has been found to be as natural antidepressant where a &#34; recent study was done involving 40 adults suffering from depression, with one group given saffron supplements and another placebo for six weeks. After six weeks, those who took the saffron extract reported a significant change in their condition for the better, while those in the placebo group reported nothing significant&#34; (ibid, n.d.).<br /><br />A growing trend of credible academic and/or scientific sources investigates Saffron's extract in relation to health benefits. In a scientific study that was recently published back in 2013, the article &#34;Protective effect of saffron extract against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in isolated rabbit heart&#34; that was accomplished by Chahine, N., et al, the authors concluded, &#34;Saffron perfused during electrolysis helps trap ROS and significantly improves myocardial function; however, saffron was less effective against Doxorubicin, thus suggesting that mechanisms other than oxidative stress underlie Doxo cardiotoxicity.&#34; (Please see the picture of the abstract of this study below). This study has scientifically investigated and proved the positive effects of saffron against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in isolated rabbit heart. * Doxorubicin is  a bacterial antibiotic that is widely used to treat leukemia and various other forms of cancer.<br /><br />** I found a great article that synthesizes the major findings of health benefits with regard to saffron's extract. The article &#34;Saffron: THE SALUBRIOUS SPICE,&#34; written by Woolven, Linda, Snider, Ted, and HerbalGram in 2016, discussed Saffron's extract in relation/as an aid to<br />a) Alzheimer's Disease and cognition decline<br />b) Depression<br />c) Reproductive Health (sub-hidings)<br />  1. Sexual dysfunction induced by fluoxetine<br />  2. Sexual dysfunction not caused by antidepressant drugs.<br />  3. Men suffering from ED and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).<br />  4. Other aspects of reproductive health such as saffron's efficacy for menstrual conditions.<br />d) Eye-health<br />E) Weight Loss<br /><br />You may want to search for &#34;Crocus sativus,&#34; the scientific name of saffron if you are interested in further research on Saffron's health benefits. To conclude my review, the rating I gave to this product is based on the product's description in which it is natural and has no preservatives; the encouraging findings of saffron's extract. In other words, it is the healthy choice that I am looking for to treat depression and mood disorder. Remember to follow the direction written on the bottle.

My dislike for stevia is a personal issue.  Many folks like stevia.  I'm not one of them, and never will be.  However, I wish manufacturers would BOLDLY list the addition of stevia in a more prominent way -- make this horrid ingredient easier to spot on their product labels.  I'm really getting tired of tossing out expensive nutritional drink powders with stevia.  Had I spotted stevia in the ingredient list, I would NEVER have purchased this formula, knowing my strong revulsion to the bitter taste of this sweet leaf herb.  Manufacturers use waay more than necessary.  Why not just keep the flavors of nutritional powders neutral and appeal to ALL health-conscience taste buds???<br /><br />I also tasted no ""natural"" vanilla and chai flavor -- whatever that means.<br /><br />I absolutely HATED the disgusting stevia taste.  But I LOVED the nutritional profile.  A serving size of 65g (2 large scoops) provides 240 cal, 6g fat, 22g carbs, 15g fiber, 26g protein.  Plant based protein blend: organic hemp, yellow pea, organic brown rice, flax.  Maca Rt (2,500mg).  Chlorella.  Omega 3 & 6 EFA's.  Digestive Enzyme Blend.  Mixed Berry Complex.  Dairy-free Probiotic Blend.  *Other* ingredients: natural vanilla and chai flavor.  Xanthan gum (does not list source: corn, wheat, or soy).<br /><br />Also listed in the mineral lineup is *iron* (as citrate) 18mg (100%) and a WARNING to keep the product out of reach of CHILDREN under 6 in case of accidental poisoning/overdose of iron-containing products.<br /><br />Net weight 16.3 oz. (461g).  Servings per container 7 (total 14 scoops).<br /><br />I feel like one of the other reviewers... I REALLY WANTED to like this whole food dietary supplement product.

B07QF6VXRK,"What a difference!  Brought my old boots back to life! Rarely do my insoles wear out before the shoe comes apart - especially cheaper Walmart shoes.  However, I had some pretty decent hiking boots I bought at Wally (maybe $35) that have held up well, except for the insoles.  They were paper thin, and eventually compressed to the point that the rubber sole grid was imprinting on my heel.<br /><br />I was about to drop $100+ on a good pair of Keen boots (on the recommendation of fellow hikers), but just couldn't get myself to pull the trigger.  So I bought these insoles instead.<br /><br />I wear 9.5.  The trick was to remove the existing insoles and use them as a template to trace the correct size/pattern.  They slipped into the boots just fine, and as soon as I put them on, it was an ooooo-ahhhh moment.  Felt better than when new.  These boots have never given my blisters, and they hold firm, so it would have been a shame to pitch them because of the worn insoles.<br /><br />Very happy with these.

After 3 or 4 weeks, the stick on lens fell off.<br />Conclusion:  I suspect that the real problem was that the curvature of my sunglasses’ lenses were greater than that of the stick-on lenses, preventing a good seal.

These batteries do feel cheap but considering the price of these foot warmers I am not too surprised since portable batteries can be very expensive on their own. Regardless, the batteries do function as intended and are small and convenient.<br /><br />The batteries need to be turned on and then placed in the pouch on the top of the shoe. The shoe then has a power button on the side to turn them on.<br /><br />The heated slippers work well, probably taking 5-10 minutes to heat up and my feet stay warm. They don't feel too bulky and are comfortable to walk around in.<br /><br />I have a US size 8 feet in men and the large slippers do fit, although there is definitely spare room in the toebox.

B08CD4PS78,"Wait for it... Someone gave me this protien powder because they didnt like the texture/taste of it.  I actually really like it and it seems like a good, no fuss product.  6 ingredients with one being a plant based protien blend that does not contain pea protien.  For whatever reason, pea protien hurts my stomache and most non-dairy powders have that.  So far so good.  But here is where things take a turn - I went to their website to purchase it and they show two different pictures of the container, one with significantly more weight and serving size but the same amount of servings.  However there is no option for big or small, they just sell it 'by the jar' when you want to buy.  Not a big deal, I assume its the smaller one, but I generally  like to know exactly what Im getting and it almost seems like false advertising.  Then the big red flag is after I entered my payment info, the next page is an upsale page - 'wait!<br />Before you complete your order, just this once, we want you to have the benefits of three jars for 65% savings, you wont see this offer ever again for as long as you live, dont waste this amazing opportunity!' - blah blah, no thanks.  Next page, same thing.  Ok.  And the next page.  And the next page.  And the next page.. On and on until Ive made my way through the entire product catalog.  Dont get me wrong, I understand the psychology of upsaling and it has its place, but at a certain point it becomes clear that a company's intention is to cram as much product down your throat and turn you into one of their 'high-five' sales.  This went there and then some.  Thats a pretty off-putting way of doing business and its downright dirty.  If that doesnt bother you though and you like the product, this could be the right protien for you.  And if you take them up on all those deals you could turn around and sell it here for a decent profit actually (currently selling at $63 here  which is $23 more than the average cost buying in bulk from Gundry).  I was already locked into my one 'jar'  purchase, but I wouldnt buy this product again just based on their dirty sales tactics.",neutral,1,2021-02-15,Health & Personal Care

After this happening multiple times, only after taking the pills, I stopped taking them and will be giving them to a family member in hopes that they don't have the same reaction.<br /><br />*****UPDATE*****<br />I have since been contacted by the company and will update my review.

Make sure you read the directions before using it though. I didn’t and almost blinded myself. Lesson learned.<br /><br />I purchased it from a local box store, hoping it would do a better job of cleaning my contacts. I routinely feel eye fatigue and was throwing away perfectly good contacts prematurely because they weren’t getting clean enough using (only) my normal contact solution. Because of this, I recently switched to using two sets of contact lenses, which I’d hoped would allow the contacts to soak longer, and get cleaner, after wearing.<br /><br />Ultimately, the missing solution was Clear Care. I now use this once every 2 to 4 weeks to give my lenses that deep clean they’ve been missing. It’s eliminated the tired eyes feeling I usually get after 15 to 20 days of use, and they feel new and cleaner than ever.<br /><br />I let my lenses soak for the recommended time of 6 hours, if not longer, then clean, rinse and soak them (overnight), using my normal contact solution. I wear them the following day while putting the other set of contacts through the same steps.

B01JZ709AY,"Good lower back support, no belly support , can be seen through clothing that is snug I have been suffering with lower back pain since the beginning of my pregnancy.  I am early in the pregnancy, but wanted to give this a try.  I am going to continue to look for something with more support.  While this does provide good back support, it is not enough for me.  Especially once my belly starts getting larger.  I have seen ones that support the belly and back and seem to have good reviews.  This is also not seamless, so if your pants/shirt is at all snug around the brace, you will be able to see the outlines of it.  My conclusion is that this is an okay piece of support, but definitely not the best and I would not purchase another one.

Absolutely disgusting. I question if anyone giving this product a positive review has tried another form.

B007MD1MEQ,"Don't Believe the Hype Although I am going through a return problem with the seller I am going to try and keep this review as product oriented as possible.<br /><br />First of all HumanWare boasts about their super crisp braille display that users rave about.  To be honest here I didn't notice much difference between this and the Smart Beetle 14 cell braille display by HIMS.  The price between the two is significant though, the Smart Beetle (which I've also reviewed) is around $1300 USD however the 14 cell display does make it a more cumbersome job to read much of anything.<br /><br />When I got my HumanWare Brailliant BI 32 I was excited, like a kid at Christmas time for sure.  The unit came in some pretty sturdy packaging and it came with a bunch of goodies.  The carrying case that it comes with is a let down in my book, it's just a neoprene thing with a zipper at the side of it, honestly I felt more like I was going to drop it putting the Brailliant into or taking it out of the carrying case.  For something I'm spending nearly $3000 on you should either not mention the free carrying case or get a better one like with the other braille displays.<br /><br />The box also comes with a USB cable and it's one of the high end shielded ones, which as the manufacturer reccommends you should only use that one.  You can also just go down to any store that sells USB cables and get another shielded one for not much money.  It's not like there's a magical stone inside that thick part of the cable or anything.  It also had a pretty huge and awkward DC power converter/charger thing.  I didn't verify this but I assume it's got a power condition inside of it so in the event of a power surge the charging unit itself will burn out instead of the braille display.  I hope that's the case anywahs.<br /><br />As for the Brailliant BI 32 itself I did not get a chance to test it with my iPhone since the bluetooth didn't work, but I did get to play with a few different screen readers and PC's.  It's performance was really quite responsive and the button layout was really very easy to figure out.  The one thing HumanWare figured out was their thumb keys, those things do rock pretty hard core in my humble opinion!  The perkins style braille keyboard was pretty standard issue honestly, but it had a nice and fluid motion.  Some braille keyboards are so stiff and noisy and clanky you just give up on typing because it sounds like a crappy techno song or something LoL.<br /><br />For me personally I feel like HumanWare has spent more money making up marketing material for these than they have in R&D for them.

B08M9B3NRQ,"Very poor quality and design I'm not at all impressed with this scrubber brush. The only positive is that it comes with 8 refill heads. The list of cons, however, is far longer:<br /><br />> the handle is not sealed well, and will continually leak dish soap;<br />> it does NOT come with the scrubber brush pictured -- only the scrubber pads;<br />> the word ""scrubber"" is used loosely since the pads have the texture of semi-rough felt. They lack any meaningful scrubber ability;<br />> the pads are attached to the plastic holder with tape that has velcro on one side, and adhesive on the other (with the adhesive sticking to the plastic holder). The adhesive is quite poor, and the pads easily detach from the holder.<br /><br />It doesn't come close to being worth the price charged.

Smaller sections and pulling hair tight when pulling down helps...but doesnt glide nicely, and if you stop it makes a crease in your hair.

These things are SO ANNOYING and NOT worth the money!!!!  I went to Bath and Body Works and purchased SEVEN FILLED foaming hand soaps for $24 and they work a MILLION times better!!  These darn things - you get 5 for $20 and they're EMPTY!  Whatever - I'm done.  These things are awful and cheap and worthless.

AWFUL!!!!!<br /><br />Edited on June 3, 2015:<br /><br />I have tried so hard to love these bottles, but after months of use I am completely fed up with them.  The price and the look is spot on - the functionality is AWFUL.  The plastic is thin; after approximately 4 or 5 pumps the bottles begin to &#34;suck in&#34;.  Another Amazon reviewer stated it perfectly:<br /><br />&#34;Further, the bottles asphyxiate themselves over time and you have to open them to let more air in so the soap will pump out. Surmising this is bad pump design lacking proper venting to replace the volume of soap pumped out with air.&#34;<br /><br />Also, the plastic ring between the tube and the pump top wrinkles, tears and gets mashed up after multiple threadings and un-threadings of the top.  I really didn't want to spend a ton of money on foaming soap dispensers as I have five sinks in my house that need them, but this product was NOT the way to go.

B004O2A29E,"I actually enjoy wearing my contacts now :) Ok so I have have been using that cheap synthetic contact cleaner from costco for years. I recently found out how bad it is for your eyes, plus my eyes were getting more and more irritated by my contacts throughout the day. Upon recommendation from a good friend I bought this solution immediately. I was really scared to use it initially because you have to follow the instructions exactly. If you put the contacts in your eye too early then you'll burn your eyeball and that doesn't sound like fun.<br /><br />The first time I used it I left it in the solution for over 8 hours. It felt really good putting them in. I didn't have to wash them off or anything. They felt amazing the rest of the day.<br /><br />I think the problem I must have been having is too much protein build up on the lenses. It was irritating my eye and the other cleaner was obviously not doing it's job.<br /><br />This product has extended the life of my contacts by weeks. I don't have to throw them out in the middle of the day because I get frustrated with the feeling anymore.<br /><br />The only sucky part is how fast you go through a bottle. You have to refill a large case every single time. This is going to be a bigger investment than I made in the past...but after weighing the options and realizing that my eye health is really, really, really important to me I can't really put a price tag on this stuff. It helps me to go about my day with comfort and I no longer feel like I actually have a foreign object stuck in there.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.

So I'll write this one to correct the previous review.  While I believe this product is SUPERIOR in quality, it is REALLY EXPENSIVE.  I bought this product for my dog to clear up his ear infections as a result of a recommendation from a book called Flood Your Body With Oxygen, by Ed McCabe.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0962052728/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=subuphilteeni-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0962052728<br /><br />While I know this product is incredible and can do incredible things, it is far too expensive to maintain the drinking habits of an 80+ pound dog.  My dog's water dish contains about 80oz of water.  I had to use 80 drops of this liquid PER BOWL to oxygenate his water.  I went through the 2oz bottle in two days.  Literally.  That's $30+ for two days.  I just couldn't do it.<br /><br />I get the double buffering.  But my dog is 13.  I want to clear up his ear infections, but I've already spent thousands on him and nothing has worked.  I can't spend $30 every other day to help him.  So I bought an AquaGen product that is much cheaper and is already showing signs that his ears are clearing up.<br /><br />So while I would normally rate this product a 5 star, I can't because I believe it is cost prohibitive to the average consumer.",neutral,1,2012-06-15,Health & Personal Care

Cosmetic damage looked real ugly for about a year. I'm not sure where I heard about MR Clean Magic Erasers, maybe some online car repair/body work forum ...but WOW, after destroying a couple of these little sponges they actually worked out every single last visible scuff mark (aside from one or two spots you could still see if you looked super closely).<br /><br />I have used them to remove black TAR from countertops. Successfully, and without much effort at all. After trying many other products, unsuccessfully.<br /><br />The reason I got on the computer to leave this review, is because ten minutes ago I just used a TIIIIIIINY corner of a Mr Clean Magic Eraser to save my $150 sunglasses ...how did I damage them you ask? I dropped them into an old RUSTY wheelbarrow, and then an electric hand saw tumbled over them - soooo painfully dragging the lenses face-down across the rust and scratching them. Cried myself to sleep, woke up, and tried a Magic Eraser in the morning. Successfully, and without much effort at all. All birds on the property sang in unison.<br /><br />I have been keeping these IN STOCK under my sink since 2014.

The fiber strands are only 12 inches long.  When I have purchased mop heads in the past, the strands were longer (around 15 to 17 inches).  Why am I mentioning this?  When you are using a mop that has short strands, the mop head covers less ground and you end up having to use more &#34;swipes&#34; to cover the area that a large mop would have covered.  For small jobs, it's not a big deal.  But for larger jobs, a larger mop head is better.  I will keep using this mop head until it wears out.

After I Measured and RE-Measured the base unit and compared it to the template, I felt I was 99.997% accurate and confirmed the manufactures template measurements were very very close ... using a digital caliper I was able to get within .030 of the pencil marks I made on the template ---- close enough for the girls we dated in High School ----  utilizing a piece of standard 3/4 inch painters masking tape --- I again measured, with a tape measure, the EXACT Center of my ""After A-Coil  Duct""  and carefully -- but skillfully -- using an ULTRA FINE TIP SHARPIE, marked the center location on the Duct --- using very Simple Math (not common-core bs) I found the distance from the Center of my Duct to the Center of the lamp holder on the base unit and the Center of the Hole on the template and marked the duct carefully....I did this for BOTH Lamp Holes.... Being in the Electrical Service field for many years, I had thee exact size hole saw required AND  recommended by the manufacture --- Buuutttt -- I choose to error on the side of caution and use a 1/4inch larger diameter hole saw ---- juuusssttttt incase my ""math"" was off a little ( I had some adhesive backed foam tape I was prepared to use IF the holes were too far off or out of round ).<br /><br />I gingerly drilled a pilot hole with a #35 drill bit for the Center of Each Lamp in the Duct and taped the manufactures templet to the duct utilizing the measurements previously mentioned ----- I was astonished and to my amazements the Tape Measure I used earlier to measure the locations of the center of the holes were Spot on to the Template!!!!  Henceforth, and with wild abandon, I installed a Hole saw in my Cordless drill and drilled through the ductwork above the A-Coil --- being extremely careful NOT to let the hole saw cut all the way through the thin sheetmetal,  --- I didn't want to play ""go fish"" for the cutout in the bottom of the duct ----- I cut through about 2/3rds - 3/4s of the duct and used a pair of pliers to bend the cutout back and forth until it separated from the duct and removed the ""burrr"" with a piece of emery cloth.<br /><br /> The mounting screws used to fasten the unit to the duct didn't fit holes in the unit ----- soooo, again using the tape measure and a sharpie, I carefully but strategically measured and marked the mounting hole location on the duct, and used a #35 drill bit to predrill the holes for the mounting screws----- again spot on ---  once the mounting screw holes were drilled I placed the unit on the duct and made sure ALL the mounting Holes lined up ---- if they didn't line up, I feared it would be a ""Do Over"" either above or below or left or right of my original measurements.... no big deal, after reading many ill reviews of the mounting template being off -- I was prepared for the worse --- adjusting my location ----whew--- luckily all was good, due to my superior tape measuring capabilities.<br /><br />I used latex gloves and installed the lamps into the lamp holder being extremely careful to avoid touching either lamp.  Everything lined up and after using extreme care utilizing the manufacture supplied screws, I mounted the Unit to the Duct and plugged the unit in.<br /><br />Oh Man !!  All Good !!<br /><br />Unit powered up, and has been working non-stop since install.

Inside has 3 size options for your ears and you can choose silicone or foam ear buds for your comfort of choice, I stick with silicone. I also like the magnet feature, so when the dBuds are not in use you can hang them around your neck by its leash and the actual left and right dBud magnetize together and it becomes a necklace to make sure you don't lose them. Usually I use them to help cancel out noise when I am working, it helps me focus. I've also experimented taking them shooting and they reduced about the same amount of noise as the usual heavy duty gun ear muffs, the only difference was dBuds were much more comfortable and the size was obviously more compact.

This fits the bottle as advertised, but I knocked off one star because if you accidentally knock over your bottle of hibiclens, this pump allows it to spill out all over the place.

The flosser is kind of cool and does have a good bit of pressure. My teeth and gums do feel better after using it. The different spray heads are nice, too. Surprisingly, the flosser requires a proprietary charging cord whereas the toothbrush uses a USB-C charging cable. Both connect to a USB-A jack for power. The flosser is big and bulky in the hand owing to the water tank and requires the user to twist and contort to keep the water pumping.

Even though I used solder wick to clean the holes completely trying to maneuver the tabs through the holes would be much simpler if they used tabs that were a bit longer and more sturdy.<br /><br />One last thing about the installation, if you find that your toothbrush vibrates a little louder than it did before you changed the batteries, wrap a couple of pieces of electrical tape around the plastic housing which holds the batteries.

Neither is notably high-quality, and instead of the combination, I'd recommend buying superior products separately. The scraper is made entirely of plastic, and while it holds the blade securely, it feels fairly flimsy as a unit. The blade guard is hard to retract and extend, even right out of the box seeming to need some kind of lubrication; the blade doesn't retract itself, so an object or finger that's drawn right along the edge of the blade is still in danger of being cut. While it scrapes okay, it's not a well-made or well-designed tool, even compared to the low-end tools from big-box hardware stores. The cleaning spray, similarly, just doesn't seem to work that well. I tested it multiple times on a greasy glass cooktop, one of the applications it's sold for, and found it didn't even come close to removing the gunk as well as my usual Weiman glass cooktop cleaner.

The whole apartment smelled like orange which was great.  It was not strong either which is good but you can always make it more or less without the amount of drops you put in it.

This review is for Premium Lutein Vision Support Formula (Best Eye Care &amp; UV Protection) w/ High Potency Lutein (20mg), Vitamin A, Bilberry Extract, Grape Seed, Zinc for Eye Strain, Dry Eyes, Red Eyes - 60 Capsules by Sigmaceutical. I have had issues with my vision for the past 20+ years and have been through various levels of eye glasses and am currently wearing Ortho K contact lenses to try to correct / treat my vision. I also work night shift and have to work on a computer for 12 hours a shift. My eye Dr. has told me to do everything I can to help my vision and taking Lutein was one of those things.<br /><br />These capsules are full of various ingredients that can help with the various eye issues that we all can have as we get older. Dry eyes from allergies, eye strain from computer and / or cell phone usage, and just age in general can be helped over time by adding Lutein to your diet. I have taken other forms of Lutein in the past and had pretty good results. These capsules have the Lutein as well as other ingredients that can assist with vision improvement. Granted the ingredients and the dosage is not established by the Food and Drug Administration but there are studies that say the ingredients will help.<br /><br />The capsules are not very large and are easy to swallow (either one or two at a time) with whatever drink you choose. Taking them with a meal may help with absorption and is usually recommended. Upon opening the bottle there was a slight odor to the capsules but seems to have gone away after a couple of days of being open.

Based on these materials I opted for the Aria because of accuracy, ease of setup and sync and its non slip legs. After receiving and and epic set up experience I can refute the easy set up. It's convoluted - the setup guide starts with downloading the app which then leads the user to the Fitbit website to do the set up. Problem is, you must join Fitbit on the app which is utterly unclear.  That's worth a good twenty minutes frustration. Once logged in the setup is pretty easy - other than the units dripping back to default a few times.

You’d be better off buying ice cream and putting it in a blender and drinking it, as at least the ice cream has better ingredients.  Ok, so this stuff taste good, but that’s all it has going for it.  I mean, just look at the ingredients.  You know the first ingredient listed has the highest percentage in what you’re eating, right?  Hydro whey isolate isn’t listed or it’s so far down on the list of ingredients it’s obsolete.  Plus whey protein concentrate is listed second.  Why even have that at all, that’s like protein drinks from five years ago before they discovered better protein.  Corn flour blend?  Come on, this stuff is absolutely garbage.  The reason why they use so many different types of protein sources is so they can load it with one good one and four other bad ones.  A five pound container of Optimum Nutrition runs ten dollars more than this stuff and is 1000 times better quality.  This stuff is only two pounds and almost fifty bucks, it’s a joke.  Again, the only thing this stuff has going for it is the taste and to be honest after about three days of drinking this stuff you’re gonna get tired of it.

So it took several puffs to light and the batteries would last about 4 or 5 days(25-30 cigarettes). That's probably pretty good when you consider what a tough job resistive heating is for a battery. It takes a while to recharge, especially since my car's usb charger doesn't work unless the ignition is on. But, it sure is windproof and maybe safer than other lighters to use while driving and I'll keep it in the car for a backup.

My allergist recommended using it year round for allergies.<br /><br />When I saw this NetiPot Sinus Rinse in a different configuration, I erroneously thought that NetiPot was a product only offered by NeilMed and didn't realize it's a term for a product offered by other manufacturers - in this case Rabuhara.<br /><br />I received two of the products, but they came with no box or instructions - only the two bottles in a clear cellophane bag.  There was no paperwork to even give you direction to where to go to get instructions.  Note that I received the product as part of the Vine Program, so perhaps it was shipped before their packaging was complete.

The smell will be overwhelming at first but it does go away after 8+ hours. I like to spray it as soon as I'm home for the day. This gives it time to neutralize the smell and for the mint smell to dissipate.<br /><br />Con: this is the reason why I couldn't give it a better review. The bottle sucks. It leaks when you spray it at a slight angle. It's hard to get into the shoe since it won't spray when the bottle is upside down. The nozzle is terrible because it doesn't evenly distribute.

After a week went to 1 full capsule and love the results.  I have so much energy, drive, motivation, focus and ability to remember.  I really think that at 67 I have lost a lot of my &#34;mind&#34;.  With Optimind, I am back like I was in my 20's.  If you think it is expensive, call them and order 6 bottles at a time, it gets the cost down to $25 a bottle.  My husband, who usually just laughs at my supplements, tried one, he takes one daily now.  Both of us love what it does for our mind and energy.  After 3 weeks on them, thought I probably should take a day and rest, well, I did rest, after cleaning out the garage, cleaning my car inside and out, two hours of  shopping and coming home to fix dinner.  Before Optimind, I would open the garage door look at the mess, and close the door - it all seemed like too big of a job. Most supplements are hype, not Optimind.  Not sure why it didn't work for the people that rated it anything less than a 5 unless they are some of the few people that still have their &#34;minds&#34; intact.

B07NBMCCLQ,"Not A Fan I’m not confident in the legitimacy of the company that makes this product. It’s a little sketchy that the QR codes on the package either lead to a dead page (404 error) or the one that goes to their website it just a single splash page with a 8 bullet list of marketing points. So much for that “Free User Guide” they promote, or the “Get your next bottle free!” Promotion. I tried doing additional research on Gods Greens and came up with very little. I’m hoping they may just have poor marketing, but for any product that I put in my body, I want to know that I can trust the company making the product, and that all of the claims they make are legitimate.<br /><br />What I DO like about this product is that it’s manufactured in an FDA-registered facility, made in the USA, and 3rd party verified. It’s also good that the product contains black pepper, because turmeric studies have proven it’s more effective in conjunction with pepper. However, I’m not sure if they have enough black pepper for the ratio of turmeric. The youtheory brand I’ve been using for the past year has 10mg of black pepper for every 1,000mg of turmeric. The Gods Greens brand only has 15mg of pepper for every 2,100mg of turmeric.<br /><br />Of the claims on the bottle, one that I’m not too sure about is the bottle’s label states “Certified Organic by Organic Certifiers”. In doing some research, you’ll find that a lot of times organic products slip through the cracks. I tried to contact Gods Greens at the phone number they listed to understand the process of being organic certified, but got an answering machine. Granted, it is a Sunday, but it could be like that all the time. Didn’t help my suspicion with the legitimacy of the company.<br /><br />Lastly, I was excited at the high-volume of turmeric in these (2,250mg) as listed on the front of the bottle, but in flipping over and reading the back - the serving size is THREE capsules!! That was NOT clear in the product description or from looking at the packaging. What I thought at first was a great value of for this product quickly changed when I realized I had to divide that by 3 to get the true cost for “1 serving” of these.<br /><br />In short, I am disappointed by misleading marketing, serving size, and have concerns about the trustworthiness of the company that makes these. I will be going back to purchasing my turmeric supplements from youtheory, and/or keeping my eye open for a different brand (nothing wrong with youtheory, just a little pricey).",negative,1,2020-09-06,Health & Personal Care
B07PNXPW9K,Like and dislike I love that these have so much room for pills.  You can see by the pic that I can fit 6 capsule size (including Vit D which is huge) and three other pills.  I like that they have labels for the days of the week and that it has an outer case to keep them all together.  I love that I can take out one day and carry it with me because it is so small.  I am using it as a month long med container.  I take pills twice a day but hate filling my med container so I put them all in the same slot and take the am leaving the pm for that night.  I dislike that they are rounded at the top as it makes it really hard to get out the individual day compartment.  I hate that on Sunday's day the 3 slot down doesn't close at all.  It came that way.  I contacted the seller within two days of receiving the product.  It has been one week and I have heard nothing from them.  I had already filled the entire month of meds and when closing the container realized the one out of 28 slots didn't close or otherwise I would have returned it right away.  So note to anyone who buys check each compartment before filling so if it is broke it can be returned.  I ordered two of these and the other came fine.  The second pic shows a size comparison.  The container in the top right is the one I bought.  The one on the left is a 3 a day med container that holds even more than this container and the one on the bottom is a 4 a day that we use as a monthly one for a kid who takes less meds.,neutral,1,2019-05-14,Health & Personal Care

I bought from some of his advertisers over the years and have been pleasantly surprised each time. This product was no exception.<br /><br />It's basically a multivitamin you can mix in a water bottle, shake it up, and have a juicy tasting beverage that gives you energy. I usually end up taking it twice, breakfast and some time after lunch. Tastes good and really made me feel energized. It definitely quenches that sugar / fructose craving I get in the mid day. It also makes me feel pretty good throughout the day.<br /><br />This stuff could also be useful for hikers and outdoorsmen who need these vitamins for sustained energy. Put it in a little container and mix it with your water.<br /><br />There are some cons to this product you should be aware of, though.<br /><br />1. It's expensive. You can get stuff 75% cheaper as chewies and pills.<br /><br />2.  Youngevity MLM sellers advertise and spam on health forums and sometimes claim their products can cure and prevent diseases.

B00XQ9LQ6O,"LOVE this stuff!! This is the only form of iodine that I can take.  Not only that years ago I was treated for Lyme disease.  My heavy metals were tested and my Lead and Mercury were off the chart.  While at an amazing clinic I was also treated with chelation therapy to reduce my heavy metals.  By the time I left my Lead and Mercury were about 1/2 of what they had been, but were still way too high.  I came home bought an IV pkg from a local Dr. but they made me wait 4 months before I could start chelation therapy again.  During that time I was taking 5-7 of these a day to help with my energy.  I had read that this can remove heavy metals, but??? how effectively.  When the Dr. finally had time to see me 4 months later and they tested me for Heavy metals they were all but gone!!!  This stuff had pulled the rest of them out of my system.  The $1,000 I paid just had to be used for the occasional Vitamin C IV, because no one ever refunds money.  Now, the thing about heavy metals is that they can get into every cell so you clean out the blood and other stores will be released.  Meaning it might take years and years to completely remove all of the heavy metals depending upon how long you had mercury in your mouth, how much, or how long you were exposed to other things. If you are using it for anything other than as an iodine source you might want to have your Heavy Metals tested to check your progress.  I have not had my heavy metals tested in years, but this product helps to give me energy and helps me to feel good so I continue to take 3-5 per day.  They are staples in my ever shrinking supplement list.",positive,0,2019-09-03,Health & Personal Care

I tried a host of other products which only seemed to lose effectiveness within minutes of application.  A neighbor recommended Thealoz Duo drops and I tried it.  It relieved symptoms for hours.  It is sterile from the bottle because it pours out of a filter which blocks bacteria from entering the bottle.  Anyway, it worked for me when all others didn't.

B003B6SLMO,"If you have chronic muscle pain or just overdo it like I do UPDATE:  I thought I had ordered the Metagenics Intensive Curcumin blend supplement, but this is the multivitamin.  I haven't taken the multi yet but I will.  I can't find the Curcumin supp. on Amazon so had to order from another site.  However, any company that can make a supplement that is that incredible deserves me trying their other products.  Here's my Metagenics Curcumin review:  I  rarely write reviews, but I have to say something about this curcumin supplement.  If you have chronic muscle pain or just overdo it like I do, this supplement is incredible.  My personal result was for very bad lower back pain from overdoing it.  From barely being able to crawl out of bed, the pain was maybe down to 50% in one day.  Each day later it reduced 10-20%.  This is all while doing essentially nothing to help my back except a few stretches.  After my back healed, I passed my bottle to my friend, and in the SAME DAY his shoulder pain stopped, which had been hurting for a month.  Tip:  2 in morning, 2 at night, don't skip a day at the beginning.  Your muscles have to heal, and healing depends on your body but minimum takes a week.  The pain may leave, but your body needs to keep healing.",positive,1,2018-06-11,Health & Personal Care

B00YGKYJGG,"First day impression and details and manual Hi just received my order of style 1 chair, the black “space tub egg escape pod” bestmassage chair.<br />Seems a day or two after ordering I got a text with a phone number to call and they found a date I’d be home and gave me like a 2 hour delivery window.<br />The chair sat on 2 wood strips in a bag and padding inside a heavy cardboard box.<br />It chair looks just like the amazon ad even though I believe the model number is a bit different, the manual is correct.<br />The imitation leather textured vinyl looks better than in the ad I think because I wasn't sure it was upholstered on the sides and it is there too.<br />The chair is solid, nothing feels of flimsy cardboard at all but I don't let anyone sit on the arms or abuse it.<br />I’m glad it’s not high maintenance real expensive leather.<br />I’ve uploaded the main pages of the manual for your viewing, the simple assembly info is in the last pages.<br />I believe others have said the side arms can be easily removed if needed although the manual does not say this and I just barely got it through the door sideways out of the box with 3 people without having to remove anything. We did risk damaging the upholstery because it was pretty tight, so I'd advise to remove the arms if you can if it's pretty tight don't force it.<br />It looks just like the picture and I’ll try to give an update after some time.<br />I have a kill a watt meter and it shows the stand by watts used is 1.7 which isn’t bad although i have read ideal is under 1 watt. In use it consumes around 50 watts with heat selected as well although the manual says 100 watts so any outlet can power this chair.<br /><br />It has a small outlet 24v transformer so the chair electric system can’t shock a user as our skin can resist that low so that is safe too.<br />The Bluetooth speakers on each outside are satisfactory and very basic simple with no control on the chair or wire or jack to attach to, you just find it in your phone’s search and it pairs. My phone volume turned all the way up can fill the room alright with music, this could perhaps really serve someone in a small room so they don't need a stereo system for their music needs.<br />All you have to have is the chair plugged in.<br />It fills the room with the sound of a small stereo with some alright base even and no distortion to say.<br />It’s odd the speakers face outside instead of inside the chair but it works and can double as music for the room anytime desired seems to be the concept.<br />I can't say the bluetooth connection will work all the time you get in the chair because I don't use the speakers much and I did have an occasion where I had to turn the main power stitch off at the back and back on to get the bluetooth to connect to my phone so I haven't played around with it to learn it's ins and outs.<br />The build in left panel controls on the chair are basic and display the run time up to 30 min and also A1 through A6 when the auto button is pressed. The manual says to not run it more than 30 min continuously, then you just need to give it 15 min off to let the motors cool/rest is what it says. So if you get it, don't let too many people line up and try it out without a rest.<br /><br />The right side wired remote control is large and much more elaborate and includes a colorful detailed digital display and options like being able to raise or lower the legs unit by themselves to about 45 degrees, this is done by an airbag between the leg unit and chair.<br />In fact you can move the leg unit and or the chair back without turning on the chair massage functions.<br />Also when the chair is off, it can be sat in a bit like a regular chair because the rollers part at the top under the flip in place when desired head pad.<br />Although you may want more padding if sitting for a while stationary just add a lounge chair pad etc<br />Although your legs movement is a bit restricted as well as your body might make long sits odd.<br />The leg foot rest can not be slid out of the way although I suppose you could completely remove or leave it off and plug the air lines if you wanted to....but then you should perhaps buy a lessor chair.<br /><br />The control buttons are not illuminated, it would be nice if they were but just a minor complaint when using in a dark room and very sensitive to touch as if they were a touch pad and there is always a beep sound when a button is pressed unless the button is not effective for that auto program mode you may be enjoying as some buttons only pertain to manual mode.<br />Assembly was easy, the foot rest attachment pins now have pull spring instead of the removable clip some complained about figuring out.<br />There is a plug and 2 air line tubes to plug together under the leg foot rest.<br />Everything is shipped in one large box.<br />The chair can recline just a bit more than zero gravity or you can leave it up while enjoying the massages.<br />There are Velcro and also zippers for some of the pieces which is nice in that you can get access to and also add more foam if you ever so desired like in the head pad or under the main back seat panel.<br />The main back seat area has a Velcro pad and under that is a zippered fabric panel and under that is a center hammock like strap that serves as support, you can see the 3 motors and 4 rollers exposed at this point and looks reasonably simple and roomy inside where the tract runs the rollers.<br />So far this is a great chair for $800 and it’s very obvious that the chairs selling for many many thousands of dollars are well over priced for rich cats to throw their money at it seems other companies have really cornered the market and are stubborn on the price.<br /><br />I’ve read reviews on very expensive chairs and the reliability and satisfaction is no better than the reviews for this chair is what I got out of all the reading from others.<br />Yes the 6000 dollar chair may have a better warranty but when the warranty is over how much are they going to want for parts when they charge so much for the chair to begin with?<br />This chair is the real deal I’d say not for frail people it’s not a stationary vibrating motors points similar priced chairs that look kind of like this one, no this one does actually have the S track that the rollers move on up and down your body as they do the different options and it really is nice that it goes down past your ass is a real pleasure.<br />Vibrating chair pads can be very nice and all some people want and that is great but this is more deep and pressing for those that want that.<br />If you don't want the legs massage, I did see, I believe this same company, makes a like gaming chair that has the shiatsu S track but no legs but it might not fit large people but it is even less in price.<br /><br />The foot roller is strong but you can move your feet so that it’s not on the sensitive area or put heavy socks on.<br />The extend stretch setting is very interesting as it grabs your legs and with the air bags and then draws the legs down while moving the body up, I like this setting for new users to surprise them LOL.<br /><br />Update after a 3  months:<br />We still like it and it does impress adult friends who enjoy sitting in it and you can chat with them as they enjoy it.<br />I am surprised that none of these rollers on a track chair companies, even the super expensive ones, seem to install the stationary vibrating motors from those inexpensive massage throw on a regular chair pads that are sold in common local stores to go with the shiatsu moving track so that we would get the massage rollers with it's actions and the little cheap stationary motors vibrating could really up the game and the happy sighs and moaning of the user whole body at once LOL.  Perhaps I will try putting the affordable vibrating pad on top of the massage chair and sitting in them and turning them both on and see! LOL<br />It's important to destress our bodies and treat our body to give it the space and time it needs to rejuvenate and unfortunately we aren't yet taught how to quiet our obsessive internal thinking that is causing a lot of our stress to begin with in our daily lives, massage devices of whatever type you buy might help and there's so few pleasures in the adult world so why not.<br /><br />Well I feel empty of anything else to say, that’s it for now.<br />Take care of yourself!<br />Xo",positive,1,2019-08-16,

B0011UWU4M,"Pretty stationery set, but the envelopes are weird This stationery sets comes nicely packaged in a sturdy cardboard box with an attached lid.  Included are a package of folded note cards in an attractive abstract graphic, a package of square one-page note papers (the bottom of the box calls these ""message sheets"" -- they are smaller than the notecards -- ivory in color and sized about three-and-one-half inches square) -- and a package of envelopes.  There is also a silver-colored retractable ink pen which writes in black ink.  The quality of the paper is a little above average, but not heavyweight.  For the money, it's not a bad set.<br /><br />What I did not like about the set is the design of the envelopes.  The envelopes are plain ivory, sized to fit the notecards.  But they are not like a regular envelope where you insert the notecard at the top of the envelope.  These envelopes are ""end-loaders"".  They remind me of the little envelopes you get from the bank when you ask for cash back at the drive-in.  I think they are weird, and for me the unusual design of the envelope spoiled the function to which I was going to put these note cards.  I don't want to give my friend a thank you note for inviting me to her nice dinner party and have her think I'm handing her a pay envelope.<br /><br />These are going to Goodwill, minus the pen.

B01GK1BO7K,"The Good and the Bad I recently ordered this and my husband and I have been using it for almost a week, I wanted to be able to leave a fair review, not just based on one use. Our UPS delivery guy left our box in the rain, not taking the time to leave a plastic bag over it like in the past, so the box was thoroughly soaked, thank goodness the contents inside were wrapped in plastic or this probably would have been ruined. Right out of the box this looked and felt much more solid and expensive looking than I expected. Looks like leather, but I don't think it is. I liked that it came charged, and that the charging cord is detachable so that definitely gives you more freedom. It doesn't have alot of modes/buttons;  on/off, reverse the direction of massager, and heat on/off. I have to say we both found that it does really give a great massage. And you are able to maneuver it around to massage that area that needs it. I personally have fibromyalgia and my neck ALWAYS hurts, ALWAYS. This massager was AMAZING for making my neck feel relieved, I really didn't know what to expect, but as far as how well it massaged, I would give it 5 stars! It was a slow deep massage. My husband moved it around from his neck, his shoulders, his back, and he was really impressed too!<br />The reason I give it 3 stars...<br />I deducted a star because the heat, I didn't notice any at all, just a red light?? So that is a non-existent advertised feature.<br />And I deducted one other star for value. I received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. At the time it was listed for over $100, which I felt was a little steep. Although it gives a great massage and looks like expensive leather, it is not. It only has one speed and one option to change the direction of the massagers. But I guess you could look at from this stand point, it does give a great massage and you would easily save the money from getting a massage elsewhere on this unit you could use over and over. Had the heat worked and maybe had a few other type of massaging features I would gladly pay the $100 asking price",neutral,1,2016-07-11,Health & Personal Care

I have been using colgate white for a couple years and probably never would have tried this if not offered to test it out.<br />The first day I used it I honestly didnt read the directions...most toothpastes say use a pea size.

B08FBHQWZK,"Light Weight and extremely easy to use Background:<br />I am a Scout leader in Washington state and have been on Cpap therapy for nearly 20 years. I love the outdoors and for many years this meant that I would have to suffer through many nights without my Cpap to be able to take scouts out into the wilderness.  Several years ago while searching for new ways to be able to bring my Cpap with me I found the K5 by Max Oak.  This was a game-changer at 4.4Lbs I was able to take this with me and use my Resmed Air-Mini to have a restful night sleep on this battery I would get 5 to 6 nights and while this is great for longer trips most of our outings are only two-three nights and carrying a 4.5lb battery wasn't really needed.  My normal settings are in the 12-13 cmH2O and with the added altitude the Air-Mini has to work a little harder to keep the pressure up.  This means that any battery that I might use would not have a run time as normally listed.<br /><br />Personal Experience:<br />In our most recent outing, we were at 3500ft which I know is not super high but it's high enough to notice the difference. We left out Thursday and came back on Sunday. We had ordered the Freedom V2 (For Resmed Air-Mini) earlier in the week and were awaiting its arrival on Thursday to be able to leave for the outing. When it arrived at about 2:45-3:00 PM I took it out of the package and noticed it was at ~70% and needed to be charged.  We had some running around that needed to be done so I pulled the power plug on my AirSense 10 and plugged in the Freedom V2.  It was only on the charger for maybe an hour when we returned and were ready to head out.  If memory serves, it was somewhere in the 90's for percentage when I took it off the wall charger, I grabbed the DC charger for my Air-Mini and plugged it into the car's 12volt system while we drove to the trailhead (Please note that the Air-Mini DC plug is NOT a standard item and must be purchased separately, until this point I had never actually used it, I think it was $80 for the DC plug it will accept 12vdc or 24vdc to provide power to the Air-Mini).  using the DC converter plug it was fully charged in no time.  I was very impressed with how fast the Freedom V2 charged.  I never sleep well the first night but after the first night the Freedom V2 was still at over 60%.  I knew ahead of time that based on the statistics that the manufacturer listed it was VERY unlikely that I would get 3 nights out of the Freedom V2 but I had a plan for that.  We needed to move more food from the car to the campsite over 3 miles apart on Friday so we left one of the K5 batteries in the car in a day pack to be retrieved when we went back for the additional food.  because the Freedom V2 uses an adapter cable from the Air-Mini to charge I was able to use the normal cable from the K5 for my Air-Mini to input the 24VDC into the Freedom V2 and fully charge it.  This worked GREAT and I was able to easily fully charge the Freedom V2 in a matter of only a few hours.  Then on Saturday some of the members of our party left and they took the K5 back to the car and I was able to sleep two full nights at about 7hours the first and 8-9 hours the second and the Freedom V2 had not depleted the charge in fact there was still 8-10% left.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />At 1.35Lbs and with nearly 100WH of power this little battery packs a punch.  I always see more power drain on the trail than when testing at home (due to being at altitude and many temperature fluctuations) so being able to get two full nights from a battery that is 3lbs lighter than the Max Oak K5 is amazing it will make shorter hikes much more enjoyable.  The price is par for the course.  As these are advertised at ""Medical Devices"" I think it's really just an excuse to bump the price up an extra $100 but the build quality is nice and the interface is much better than that of some of the other options.  After reading many reviews I settled on trying the Freedom V2 and so far I am glad I did.  I only have 3 nights on the battery right now so I will reserve comments about how well the battery holds a charge over time and whether or not there is any degrade in performance over time.  I intend to do a three-night sleep test here at the house this next week and will post any useable data from that.  At this point, I am extremely happy with the quality and weight of the unit and am looking forward to any updates that Freedom may come out with in the future.<br /><br />Other considerations:<br />To address one of the other reviewer's comments about the internal parasitic drain of the battery. This is normal to some degree with any battery that has electronics hooked to it.  Most times it is very negligible and not noticeable.  If it becomes noticeable I would reach out to the company for a replacement as one of the cells may be damaged. But it is not uncommon for batteries to slowly discharge over time (many weeks or even months in storage) even lead-acid batteries do this (the effect is made more evident when you place a lead-acid battery on concrete).  Please consider discharging to ~50% and recharging any battery before use if it has been in storage.  If the battery won't discharge then hook it to the charger and allow it to awaken the cells as they may have been placed in hibernation/storage by the electronics to prevent damage.<br /><br />Its my pleasure to use this battery and I look forward to many overnights.  If anyone has any good ideas on other ways to charge this battery out in the field please contact me as I am always looking for ways to extend our trips.<br /><br />Nick V.",positive,1,2021-06-23,Health & Personal Care
B01IG3UGF6,"Take my money! I haven't had this long (but I'm an avid updater if things change) but so far, I'm LOVING this tea tree oil! I'd been using my regular brand on some skin tags (not consistently) and it hadn't done a thing but I spilled a bit of this trying to get it into a smaller bottle and rubbed what I spilled on my neck. The next day it looked like one of my skin tags wanted to fall off! I don't know any other way to test tea tree oil but I'm confident that if I ever used this for more than a couple of days in a row (even once a day) that skin tag would be history!<br /><br />Honestly, I only bought this because it was cheaper than my regular brand but it seems to work a lot better than my old brand.

I chose it based on price, but I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of the glycerin.  The bottle is thick plastic and the lid seals tightly -- no leakage issue in shipment and in storage.  That's a plus because glycerin can get messy. My bubble bath recipe worked beautifully, and the results were just as good as when I used a higher priced glycerin I purchased locally.  I have ordered other products in the Essential Depot line and every one has impressed me.

B0135ZHC52,"Fantastic peppermint oil! Peppermint is probably my most favorite essential oil.  It's so versatile and smells wonderful!  This particular product is fantastic - the oil is very potent.  It only takes a few drops to achieve maximum results.  The scent is also long-lasting!  I like to use the peppermint oil to create a natural bug spray that doesn't stink.  I'm very allergic to mosquitoes - and living in the South, that's not a good thing!  But a little of this peppermint essential oil in my spray bottle (along with water, obviously) keeps the little bloodsuckers off of me.  I worked in my yard all day yesterday and used this spray to keep the bugs off me.  It worked like a charm!

B018IAF9S6,"No more mom buns! If it were possible I would give this product 6 stars! It's not very often that I get this excited about something but trust me if you have high maintenance hair that needs straightening hit add to cart/checkout as fast as you can. This is THE BEST straightening/styling tool I have EVER used. I have curly hair that often and easily gets matted in the back, that often would find itself kinked and fried from using the flat iron. Not to mention the time... don't even get me started on the time it would take me to part out the small pieces and iron them. If that wasn't enough the burns! Just last week I pinched my wrist trying to do the back of my hair. Since getting the RoseMyst none of that has been an issue! Because of the design of the product I do not need any other utensils at all! I mean none! I have been able to cut my time down to less than ten minutes from start to finished style! What busy mom can't appreciate that! Since having this my days of messy mom bun are far and few between because I cannot say I do not have the time anymore. It is so simple to use, and I can use it at a much lower temperature ( I was using having to use the iron all the way up at 450 and I'm able to use this at 350 so BIG DIFFERENCE) and produce much smoother results than I ever could with my iron. Which also makes me feel better knowing I'm not completely burning my hair every time. It comes with a heat glove so that is nice when using the opposite hand to help assist. The instructions for the product are clear and that helps with the functionality of the product.  The LCD lets you set the desired temp and flashes the actual temp as well. The buttons lock so you don't have to worry about turning it off mid style or inadvertently turning the temperature up or down and lets you set the temperature to either Fahrenheit or Celsius.  It also has a 360 degree rotating cord so no getting stuck mid style. It does say clearly to &#34;use only on dry brushed hair&#34;. I recommend this product to anyone who values their time, is tired of wearing frumpy buns, and needs to straighten their hair. I have not found one thing that I do not like about this product.<br /><br />*Please note that I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />Update 5/30/2017<br />Well I'm currently in the market for a new straightener. This product didn't make a year with me using it about twice a week.

B00I0XXSXK,"Does what it says but cheapo quality makes it worth no more than $10 - seriously! Fit and function are great, this knee compression wrap does exactly what they claim. The workmanship (assembled in Taiwan) is pretty good, and in theory, you need this wrap to put the cold therapy just where you need it. Like most of the Active Ice system I bought at the same time, this compression wrap is made using cheapo materials - it is definitely NOT worth $30. I would feel much less ripped off if I'd paid $10 or maybe even $15 - but no more. Someone is making a killing on Polar Products - - top dollar for cheap products.<br /><br />I'd guess there are about $5 worth of thin foam-backed polyester material, sewn-in velcro hook patches, and three decent elastic bands. Five sewn-in velcro patches attach to the hoop material on the universal chilling bladder that came with your system. The velcro sticks well and the elastic bands look like they will last longer than the cheapo material the body was made from. Overall, the whole thing weighs just a couple of ounces - very light duty. The thin foam/polyester material is exactly the same junk they used in the control box to &#34;insulate&#34; the cold water pipes. (which is still leaking condensation/water through every hole and crack in the control box)<br /><br />I wore the universal bladder and my new knee compression wrap today for a few hours off and on. I can tell you that if you have fresh staples across your knee, any sensitivity in the knee area, or are easily chafed by rough things against your skin, the stiffness of this compression wrap, bladder, velcro, and elastic will cause you some additional soreness until you're used to it.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would not buy it again unless they cut the price in half. Yes, it's really that over-priced. Best solution is really just to use the black universal strap with velcro ends to hold your chill bladder in place. If that's not enough, use another Ace bandage. You should be using one under the bladder also, since the bladder can't go against the skin.",neutral,1,2016-04-26,Health & Personal Care

My sister is also a health nut, so when I saw the description specified it was all natural, I was deeply intrigued. I had a discount, so I thought I would buy a bottle and gift her it to try.<br />Hands-down one of my best decisions.

B0792DJZNW,"Not a bad supplement, but taste is... strange? I'm big on BCAAs, but not so much as intra-workout or pre-workout supplments, as much as POST-workout.<br /><br />For those who promote use during workouts, the belief is that they reduce fatigue during exercise by limiting the entry of tryptophan (the stuff in your Thanksgiving turkey) into your brain. Your body uses tryptophan to make serotonin, which may contribute to fatigue (that's why you feel so sleepy after that big dinner).<br /><br />Honestly, there isn't that much research on the pre-workout or intra-workout effects of BCAAs. HOWEVER, they can help reduce muscle damage and soreness. It is generally accepted that BCAAs may relieve soreness, strain, and inflammation caused by exercise. BCAAs can also stimulate the synthesis of protein in your muscles, which promotes muscle-building. They also suppress the breakdown of muscle protein (and thus, muscle loss). Finally, it is understood that intense exercise can result in reduced immunity, which may be due to a decrease in the amino acid glutamine. Glutamine is a fuel for immune cells. Since BCAAs can be converted into glutamine in muscle, they can help promote the immune system.<br /><br />From my personal research, I have found that the consumption of BCAAs anywhere from 30 minutes to 3-4 hours POST workout can really have a discernible impact on recovery. And THAT is why and when we use them in my house. I drink them after a hard swim. My kids drink them after super-tough track, football, or swimming practices or tough workouts in the gym.<br /><br />So from the perspective of BCAAs, this product seems to have it together. BUT, the ""Blue Hawaiian"" flavor is.... strange and kind of disgusting. I thought it would be like the drink (rum, blue Curacao, pineapple juice, cream of coconut). The only thing I can really taste is the coconut, which pretty much tastes like chugging suntan oil after a tough workout. This really needed more citrus flavoring, as well, to balance the taste. The kids definitely do not like this one, and will only use it as a mix-in for smoothies, where the coconut flavor actually adds something. Mix it with a banana, some OJ, some pineapple juice or slices, and some ice, and it's tolerable.",positive,0,2019-05-14,Health & Personal Care

B00AELKZL4,"Very Skeptical I purchased priteva as a possible replacement for nioxin recharging complex. I've taken one tablet daily for about 45 days and have seen no results. No increase in shine, no faster growth and no thickening. I expected that if the product actually contains the powerhouse ingredients listed on the label... I'd see some evidence of taking it.<br /><br /> I was skeptical about taking this product as it seem too convenient that the ingredients listed are so close to the discontinued nioxin formula which is selling at very steep prices right now. There is very little information on the web about the true manufacturer of the product or where or how its made.There are very few reviews and those that I did find, seemed to be from the same posters on different websites. Most of the posters indicates that they were either paid or given a free bottle to try. There is absolutely no follow up on you tube or hair boards from these users to support success or any results using priteva. Just seems shady to me.<br /><br />Of note... The RDA information is listed on the product as ""results not established"" which is interesting since the product includes very basic and widely accepted vitamins that most certainly have a RDA so what would've been the problem with listing it on the label? Again, seems shady to me.<br /><br />I will not buy it again.<br />**<br />update march 2013<br /><br />I've taken one a day for 4 months( two 60 count bottles) with no noticeable increase in growth or thickness of my hair.

I started a non-profit to give pads to homeless women and I always insist on personally testing any pad I am considering passing out because if I wouldn't use them, I won't give them to anyone else to use. They claim the pad helps reduce cramps. I was already skeptical so I wasn't surprised when that claim was bogus. The reason I'm really disappointed is because even on my light days, I had to change my underwear more than once because instead of the blood being absorbed by the entire pad, it only went forward and backward rather than spreading out, completely ruining my underwear. This was after only a few hours of wear. I'd have better absorption from a wad of toilet paper! The women who would receive these napkins rely on a pad that does its job so it's easier to maintain their hygiene during menstruation. I can go home, clean up, and change. These ladies don't always have that option.

B0B9121DFX,"2 users/90 readings each; large cuff/display; two power options included; accuracy within range [[VIDEOID:2c73ad39d6e3ee88ac30b8eb73c734f]] This is the 56th BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One BP unit<br /><br />- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet<br /><br />- One large cuff<br /><br />- One cloth carry pouch<br /><br />- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA Batteries<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.<br /><br />- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.<br /><br />- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.<br /><br />- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.<br /><br />- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.<br /><br />- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.<br /><br />- The display is large.<br /><br />- Accuracy is within range of my gold standard monitors.<br /><br />- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator. What happens is that after three readings, the first number displayed is the average. The next three numbers and beyond are the readings. Once I cycle through all the readings, the average is never displayed again unless I turn off the unit and then press the memory button again.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.<br /><br />For those who are interested, I attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5-star monitors. These monitors I consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others I tested. I listed two 4-star monitors because they have unique features such as Spanish speaking or Bluetooth. Each one of these monitors is accurate and I would highly recommend any of them.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. It does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. The arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people.

It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated. In addition, it has C.P. G.

It takes four AAA batteries or a USB Type C cable (both are included). There is an average feature after two readings. There are date or time settings in AM/PM (not military time). The cuff size is large. There is an irregular heartbeat indicator. Accuracy is spot on. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09WGYJRH8 Checkme Arm Cuff Only Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor for iOS or Android Model BP2A 4663]] – This is one unique monitor. The monitor and cuff are in one unit and this is most useful if paired with the iOS or Android app (viHealth). The cuff size is large but the display on the cuff is small. Operation is simple. This is rechargeable and comes with the USB Type C cable for charging. There is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app. There is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app. In fact, the readings can be associated with multiple users (number and amount unknown). The date and time are automated through the Bluetooth pairing with the app. As of June 2022, the app is quirky and does not always connect. The BP unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone. The [[ASIN:B09WDK7P8Y Checkme Arm Cuff Only Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor for iOS or Android ModelBP2A 0885]] is the high priced version that comes with a muscle stimulation(TENS) option.

The powder is very light and will get foamy if you blend it too long. I thought all the flavors were good - they aren't overpowering so if you are used to artificially sweetened protein mixes, you probably will find these very subtle in comparison.<br /><br />I find Promix whey protein to be a healthful way to increase my protein intake with few carbs and no soy.

B09R1D62RH,"Cute razor, but does not leave my skin smooth [[VIDEOID:dc6b69d8025a48d7ade7503b8586bc18]] If I could, I would give this electric shaver a 2.7 rating.<br /><br />The first time I used it was as a wet razor on my legs and armpits. The shaver did not shave hair off my legs and armpits smoothly and  I constantly felt a scratchy sensation on my skin. I must say, it did shave the long excess hairs, but at the end, I felt my legs and armpits bumpy and not smooth.<br /><br />So, I decided to use the electric razor dry and I was able to get rid of the excess long hairs on my legs but my legs were still feeling bumpy and was not able to get Rid completely of the tiny hairs. I still felt that scratching sensation on my skin coming from the razor as I used it. I had to repeatedly pass the razor over one section of my leg in order to remove as much hair as possible and this took kind of long. This razor was a little noisy but not something I could not tolerate.<br /><br />The razor comes with its travel pouch/bag; which makes it very convenient to take everywhere and it does not take a lot of space. I like the comfortable grip and feel when I hold it.<br /><br />Overall, I would use this razor only in times when I do not have better options.

(Keep It Simple, Stupid)!  But what is ENZOPLEX?  From looking at the label, I wouldn't have a clue what this supplement is taken for. Lets turn the bottle.<br /><br />Serving size is 2 capsules and has Serrapeptase, which comes from an enzyme that occurs naturally in the intestines of silk worms (yuck)!  Serrapeptase is used to treat a variety of ailments including carpal tunnel, back pain and migraines, to name a few.  Papain is a digestive enzyme that comes from Papaya, this aids in protein synthesis.  Papain is all in all a digestion booster and is great for people like me who eat a high protein diet.  Enzoplex boasts that it's a healthy alternative to pain relievers.  But lets look at the other side of the label.<br /><br />I'm still not seeing ANYTHING that would tell me what this is used for, aside from looking up the product on the internet or the individual ingredients.  I would hope that if I found this in my medicine cabinet I could read the bottle and know what it's used for.  That to me is the one HUGE, MAJOR downfall of this product.  The good new is, it's just a packaging issue.<br /><br />The product itself is small and easy to swallow.  As far as effectiveness I took this product for a full 30 days I didn't notice an improvement.

B09CPY6VC3,"7 head shaver. IPX6 waterproof. Model LK-6808. Unusual touch switch is not my favorite First off, I'm going to review this for face/beard shaving. I don't have a bald head (yet, anyway), so that isn't my focus.<br /><br />I have used rotary floating blade shavers for decades (usually Norelco). They work best on my face, especially for the neck region. These shavers have always featured three heads.<br /><br />Well, here we have seven heads. Seven heads!! I have used very similar shavers to this one with five and six-head shaver attachments. This is one more. The question is: Why do the high-quality venerable brands stick to three heads, and these shavers use so many more?<br /><br />The answer isn't quality of shave. In fact, I was impressed at how well this shaver cleared the stubble on my face at the end of the day. It was comfortable, and managed to navigate the nooks and crannies of my face and neck as well as my low-end Norelco (if not better). But it's no match--not even remotely close--to my top-of-the-line Norelco (though that costs about 4x as much, so that's probably not a fair comparison). But--and this is huge--the ergonomics of the shaving heads leave something to desire. First off, there's very little reservoir under the cutting heads for shaved hair (see photos). This means you'll need/want to wash the head (it's water immersible) after each shave. Second, the middle head of the seven doesn't pop up. To remove it, you have to twist it off. It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. Based on my experience with other shavers quite similar to this, expect the blades to get dull after a bit of use, and factor in the cost of an entire replacement head unit when they do.<br /><br />In terms of seven vs six vs five heads? Well, the motors in these shavers are effectively the same. So if you have seven heads, the amount of power you provide to each head is less than it is in a five head design. That's going to affect the maximum speed and also the ability to easily tackle heavy stubble. Given that I don't sense a huge amount of improvement with seven vs five (or six) heads, I'd be inclined to veer towards fewer heads.<br /><br />In general, I'd suggest that you can interchange the 7/6/5 head assemblies if you want to get a replacement.<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />Seven head cordless shaver with LCD readout of charge remaining and touch activation<br />Nose hair trimmer attachment<br />Hair clipper attachment<br />Shaver attachment<br />Two face cleaning attachments<br />Three length guides for the hair clipper attachment<br />Charging cable (requires USB-A power source).<br />Small cleaning brush<br /><br />You turn this particular shaver on/off in a very unusual way. To turn it on, you hold both of the ribbed sides with your fingers. It turns on. If you take your fingers off the sides, it turns off. There is no way to keep it on without your fingers on the sides. I didn't find this very appealing and don't see the advantage over a clipper with a standard on/off switch. I also found myself occasionally accidentally turning it off when I was using it.<br /><br />The non-shaver attachments are a mixed bag. On the plus side, the nose hair trimmer works very well. This is in contrast with the nose hair trimmers that come with clippers, which are worthless. The nose hair clipper here works as well as the dedicated nose hair clippers I've used. On the minus side, the hair clipper is quite mediocre--it operates at a low speed and struggles with any amount of hair. It's about as good/useful as the clipper that's integrated into some shaver handles. Those can clip a bit of trim hair, but they are an exercise in frustration for any serious hair removal. Same here. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, my experience is that the heads get dull somewhat quickly, and you need to buy a not-inexpensive replacement assembly. Also, cleaning the assembly is a nuisance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** 7 head shaver does a good job on face<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Acceptably comfortable in your hand<br />** Li-Ion battery: 2 hours charge for 90 minutes run time<br /><br />Cons:<br />** The odd system for turning on/off the shaver is not ideal<br />** Hair trimmer has limited usefulness<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver head assembly doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Must replace entire shaving head unit when one/more blades get dull<br />** 7th head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br /><br />Note that there is a dizzying number of similar 5/6/7 head shavers sold on Amazon. As far as I can tell, having reviewed many of them, they are all made by a handful of companies and work pretty much equivalently well. The snap-in attachments even work across different models and brands. So shop around for price.<br /><br />To be honest, this shaver would not be my first choice, because of the weird on/off system that requires touching the two ribbed sides. Your mileage may vary.",positive,1,2021-12-12,Health & Personal Care

B07WGWCK3X,"Solid solution for packing lunches I’ve started to cook more and bring lunch to work.  While I’ve typically relied on cheaper plastic food containers, I wanted to try something more “solid” and longer-lasting.  Hence, I decided to give these a try:<br /><br />• Contents and Size: This is an 18-pack box, which contains six 3-packs inside.  As noted, these are designed to hold 24fl oz, consisting of a larger (16fl oz) compartment and a smaller (8fl oz) compartment.  In reality, this is perfectly portioned for lunches that consist of one entrée and one side dish.  Although I typically prefer boxier shapes to be able to pack in more food, I did find the volume to be adequate<br /><br />• Preservability: I was a little concerned at first as the lid does not fully “snap” shut, and instead tends to slide shut.  That said, I can confirm that there were not issues with preserving food in the fridge for at least 3-4 days at a time.<br /><br />• Wash:  I often find it very frustrating and difficult to wash plastic containers, particularly cheaper ones.  Although some of those elements remain here, I appreciated the little touches like the “gripped” bottom of each container.  And in general, these are easier to wash grease off than the cheaper alternatives.<br /><br />In summary, I’m a fan of these containers and will continue to use these going forward.  It does take a little longer to wash grease off from plastic containers, but overall these is a nice efficient solution for packing lunches.  Recommend!",positive,1,2020-02-10,

B086L6QGG4,"Not a strong battery life I first want to mention that this device is very small.  It can fit in your hand.  It's not necessarily a bad thing because it packed a good punch for being so small.  In fact, the sounds seemed to be very good quality and the melodies that played were very soothing and calming.  All of my kids really enjoyed them.  Here are the problems with this device:<br />1. You have to charge the unit to 100% once it dies and CANNOT use it while it is plugged in.  So you use it until it dies and then it needs to charge to 100%.  It doesn't take too long to charge.  Maybe 3 hours or so.  I tried unplugging it before it had charged to 100% and it didn't want to work.<br /><br />2. There is no indicator of the battery life on the device.  You don't really know when it is dying or almost done charging.  So you can either choose to charge it every day before you use it or take a chance and use it until it dies.  At first it lasted us almost 5 full nights (around 50 hours of use in total).  We use it as a sound machine at night for our kids.  After a month of use, it started holding less and less of a charge.  We finally returned it after about 5 weeks because it wouldn't even last 2 full nights (or 20 hours).<br /><br />3. The ""night light"" isn't really a night light.  So the light on the device can either be set to ""on"" (which is VERY bright), ""off"", or ""blinking"" which is just simply distracting.<br /><br />If all of these things were resolved I would purchase several more because this machine was really convenient and the sounds were of good quality and not annoying or scratchy.<br /><br />*** A few things to note, we never used the night light so that was not the reason for our battery usage.  Also, I did notice that the melodies used up more battery life than the simple sounds did so if you are wanting to use it for a business with the melodies you will not be able to use it for more than 8 hours or so before needing to charge it again.",negative,0,2020-06-06,Health & Personal Care

You will also feel the caffeine effects so no issues there also.  My biggest problem with this blend is it needs a little refining to make sense.  The ""demon's blend"" section needs to look like the double dose but in a single serving.  The volume of those ingredients in the single scoop side is too lacking for it to really make any difference.  If they were to increase the levels of the demon blend and keep the caffeine the same it would make for a much better supplement and hold better grounds against the more well know pre-workouts of the world.<br /><br />Basically, they should make it the high strength dose only but reduce caffeine down to 200/300mg and put 30 servings of that in the container.  At that point this would be a top contender and would highly recommend at that point.  Otherwise this is just not hitting the mark for me and will use other more well balanced blends.<br /><br />Oh and hopefully they can switch to a safer form of sweetener as well which would make for a truly premium product.

B08M6866YK,"Initially bought because it was zero calories, carbs and sugar while water fasting. I usually use another brand of electrolyte concentrate, which does do a great job but the taste is pretty bad. I bought this to mask the flavor of the other and the other supplements I add to my water, while water fasting. I was super surprised that wow, it actually tastes really good! I think on its own for the average need for electrolytes, it could stand alone on its own. It did the job of masking the gross flavor of the other. When I did my refeed, and was craving gummy candy, I used this to make a no carb jello gummy treat. Worked perfectly! I would recommend fully. I bought the grape and the berry lemonade (tastes like a blueberry lemonade). I haven’t tried the other flavors yet. If you have to drink a lot of water like I did, it has to be enjoyable in my opinion. This is a real and honest review of how I feel and think. I buy a ton of things on Amazon and will be buying again. Not sure when, because this has 90 serving per use. I put 2 scoops into a 1qt bottle. I could do less because it has a lot of flavor.",positive,1,2022-03-15,

B01HOTXBDW,"Happier Feet After a Day in Heals I am not an everyday heel wearer but I do love wearing heels when the opportunity arrives. The problem is that my feet usually hurt after wearing them for a long time or I get blisters because I do not wear them all the time. I have used other products in the past but they always end up moving or not lasting so I have been looking for a long lasting solution. This is a heal kit that includes a toe cushion and a blister protector.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Thick pads<br />-Toe pads have a ridge for fitting<br />-Blister pad is thick and cover the whole shoe edge<br />-Very sticky backs<br />-Don't move once in place<br /><br />Cons:<br />-A bit difficult to get into place<br />-Blister pad pushes foot slightly forward<br /><br />These pads are thicker and have a more satin finish than others I have tried and that makes them more comfortable to wear. They have very sticky backs which is good for staying power but does make it a little bit difficult to get into place. The toe cushion with the ridge makes wearing the highest of heals comfortable. The blister cushion which is comfortable to wear and does work to prevent blisters after a long day of wearing your shoes, however the cushion pad does push your foot a bit forward so if your shoes are already tight these may not work. My feet are happier after wearing my heels with the pads in them.<br /><br />I received this heal kit at a discount for my honest and unbiased review and opinion.

B00H7TJE3Q,"Somewhat OK, but suction opening too narrow, and material too thick This large reusable bag is only ok.  The diameter of the  hole in the bag, to install it in the short suction slot tube of the vac, is about 1/8"" too short. My Ridgid HD14000 shop vac is a 14 gallon;  it has about a 1/16"" ridge that goes around the suction slot tube to help keep the bag in place.  That ridge is what makes the difference, making it impossible to slide the bag opening all the way where it should be (just inside the ridge). If they made the bag opening 1/8"" wider it would fit, because using the metal clamp that can be tightened, a bit larger opening would not be a problem.  Also the bag is a bit too thick, making it difficult to accommodate it inside the canister. The metal clamp could be about 1/2"" longer in circumference to make it easier to open without it coming apart.

B086HCNRJ5,"Feels Amazing! I love this product! One of my new favorite items I have purchased. It’s made of fantastic quality and doesn’t have a brand name cluttering the main piece, which is a plus for me. But the best part is the massaging vibration; it’s nice that you can use it with and without the vibration. The rolling quartz attachment feels so good and relaxing on the skin.<br /><br />Tip: place it in a cup of ice as I did in my picture to give your skin a cooling massage in the morning. Ice is excellent to put on your face as it helps with anti-aging and helps blood flow to your face. It prevents wrinkles and relieves puffiness from a night with not much sleep or when you wake up feeling puffy. Usually, I will use an ice cube or a spoon put in a cup of ice, but this wand makes it so much better because it rolls and vibrates and is way less messy than an ice cube. Rose quartz can be in water, so you don’t have to worry about that. Not sure if the metal on this will fade or rust from the water, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take.<br /><br />The second attachment t with the double rollers feels great on the neck and shoulders as a massage tool.

B0B8ZZKX4Y,"2 users/90 readings each; large cuff/display; two power options included; accuracy within range [[VIDEOID:9842346702698a96e4ff75dbd5fcb6a6]] This is the 56th BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One BP unit<br /><br />- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet<br /><br />- One large cuff<br /><br />- One cloth carry pouch<br /><br />- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA Batteries<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.<br /><br />- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.<br /><br />- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.<br /><br />- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.<br /><br />- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.<br /><br />- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.<br /><br />- The display is large.<br /><br />- Accuracy is within range of my gold standard monitors.<br /><br />- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator. What happens is that after three readings, the first number displayed is the average. The next three numbers and beyond are the readings. Once I cycle through all the readings, the average is never displayed again unless I turn off the unit and then press the memory button again.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.<br /><br />For those who are interested, I attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5-star monitors. These monitors I consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others I tested. I listed two 4-star monitors because they have unique features such as Spanish speaking or Bluetooth. Each one of these monitors is accurate and I would highly recommend any of them.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. It does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. The arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people.

It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on. Accuracy is spot on, which is atypical of wrist monitors.

It takes four AAA batteries or a USB Type C cable (both are included). There is an average feature after two readings. There are date or time settings in AM/PM (not military time). The cuff size is large. There is an irregular heartbeat indicator. Accuracy is spot on.

There is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app. There is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app. In fact, the readings can be associated with multiple users (number and amount unknown). The date and time are automated through the Bluetooth pairing with the app. As of June 2022, the app is quirky and does not always connect. The BP unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone.

There are date or time settings in 24-hour clock (military time) only. The cuff size is large and will fit most users. There is also voice broadcast mode and two alarm options.

My wife took an unopened bottle from the Twin Pack and attempted to board a southwest airlines plane. TSA made her throw it out and when she attempted to show them the references on her phone that said you could carry a larger bottle she was told that since it has hydrogen peroxide in it that it was illegal because apparently she could use it to create an explosive device onboard with it.  She had to dispose of it and was told that she couldn't carry any type of contact lense solution that had a red top on it.  She ended up throwing a brand new unopened bottle away and not having any contact lense solution with here.

B07VLBLNF3,"Vitamin Enriched Vanilla Protein Shake -  I got to try out the Basic Care Nutrisure Original Nutrition Shake vanilla flavor. This is made by Amazon Basic Care one of the Amazon brand of products. My son and I think they are fairly tasty. They taste as good as any other protein drink I have tried, even better than some. They taste very similar to Ensure vanilla protein shakes. They have 9 grams of protein and 26 vitamins and minerals per bottle. The only negatives I have worth noting are; the vitamins provide 25% of the RDA across the board; there is 15 grams of sugar per bottle; and there is 6 grams of fat. To me they taste good and maybe the sugar content has a lot to do with that too. I did check out Ensure vanilla and it too contains an awful lot of sugar coming in at 22 grams of sugar. If these are to be a cheaper alternative to Ensure, then why can I buy Ensure on the Subscribe and Save program and not these? After all these are an Amazon brand product. Maybe once these are available as a Subscribe and Save item, there will be more of a cost savings over the other guy.<br /><br />I give the Basic Care Nutrisure Original Nutrition Shake .

Now, sadly, it seems Walmart has discontinued the 300ft roll with slide cutter, leaving only the 200ft roll with basic razor edge available.  You would think the product in both packages was the same…think again!!  The product in the 300ft package was smooth and completely clear; the product in the 200ft package has vertical stripes in it, parallel with the outer edges of the film as you dispense it.  O.K., so it looks a little different…but wait, it doesn’t hardly stick to itself anymore let alone other objects.<br /><br />To be fair, this is my first roll of the 200.  I will peek at the next box on the shelf before buying it. If it has the same stripes in the wrap I will switch to Sam’s Club (Member’s Mark) wrap.  I like Sam’s equally, but their wrap only comes in a 3000ft countertop dispenser…a bit of a waste of countertop space for my kitchen; countertop space is limited.<br /><br />I’ve searched all Wally Worlds in my region, but sadly none have the 300ft available, and it isn’t available to order on Walmart’s website or app either.

B095L4QG85,"Good gummies, with two issues. I ordered these gummies based on their Raspberry Pomegranate flavor, 500 mg Apple Cider Vinegar dosage per gummy, and good brand name. They’re very similar in composition and shape to the other, more popular brand of ACV gummies.<br /><br />Like the other brand, these Solgar ACV gummies contain the ‘mother’. The mother is the cloudy stuff you see at the bottom of a bottle of ACV, and the most important ingredient. That’s what actually contains the helpful enzymes and good bacteria known as probiotics.<br /><br />I noticed right away that there was no protective outer seal around the top. Not a good start. When I popped off the top, there was a ‘seal’ on the top, but it was really just a piece of thin foam paper, and not actually glued to the top of the bottle like most actual seals on pills or vitamins.<br /><br />The smell is good… it’s definitely raspberry, and while you can smell a little vinegar, it’s not overwhelming. The taste is good as well. There’s very little vinegar taste, but they’re not something you’ll want to nosh on for a treat.<br /><br />But when I went to dump a couple into my hand, I noticed that they’re wet. For whatever reason, that really turned me off. I thought maybe I had received a bottle that was expired, but the date on the bottom says “EXP: 12/2022” so that’s not the problem.<br /><br />When compared to the leading brand, Solgar ACV gummies are (at this time) a little less expensive. The Solgar ACV gummies each have 2g of sugars and 2g of carbs, while the others have 1g of sugars, but 3.5g of carbs. Since carbs generally break down into sugars, I’d call that a wash.<br /><br />So the only negatives I have are the lack of real safety seals, and the moisture. Other than that, the taste and reported composition is good.<br /><br />Hope this helps.",neutral,1,2021-10-27,Health & Personal Care

I eventually opened the other very tight compartments and one at a time tried closing them, without adding any pills. Not one of them would close! So, I gave up.

I just didn't think I'd get all FOUR brush heads in the same color! Long story short, I got some washi tape and wrapped it around the base of the toothbrush heads to avoid confusion and I've decided to get a different, more affordable brand which doesn't trick you into thinking you're getting a variety pack of colors: right from the beginning, every toothbrush head looks identical and I have several different rolls of washi tape and more money in my pocket!",neutral,1,2019-10-27,Health & Personal Care

B000KE8ASK,"So far so good. I have had this exercise pedal machine for a little over two weeks now.  I use it for a hour and a half each day (two 45min sessions).  And so far I am really enjoying it.<br /><br />Within the first week one of my pedals was making a thumping noise/feeling on each cycle (it was definitely the pedal and not the internals of the machine) and was quite annoying, but this was due to improper positioning.  Since then I have got it in the perfect position and it no longer does this.<br /><br />Overall the operation is quite smooth, but on occasion you can feel a bit of 'grittiness' on the cycling, but nothing that severely impacts the performance of the machine.  It is most definitely quite too, and this a HUGE plus for me.  It makes virtually no noise whatsoever.  The construction of this machine is top notch, the main internals of the machine are rock solid and don't move/vibrate at all.<br /><br />As far as a good exercise is concerned, it does very well for it's small package.  Granted it doesn't have the strength of a full-sized pedal machine, but for its size it goes above and beyond what I expected.  It has just enough resistance to get a great sweat worked up and burns calories quite well.  And I am not even sure if I have mine turned up all the way (it's at least pretty close to full).  If I keep it between 15-17 MPH for 45 mins, according to the machine I burn between 420-460 calories.  Obviously this calorie count isn't 100% accurate and is probably a low-ball estimation, but even if it wasn't that is a decent amount of calories for 45mins IMO.  For my weight and age I estimate the calorie count from the machine plus 20%.  For my two 45min sessions on this machine, I estimate I burn over 1,000 calories a day on it.  And just so we are clear I am a 24 year old male and have very strong legs.  And this machine has the perfect resistance level for me.  Not too easy, and not too hard.<br /><br />As far as ease of use is concerned, it doesn't get any better than this.  It is small, portable, quite and can be used with practically any chair.  I currently use my computer chair and it works out magnificently.  I do the machine while watching some Netflix instant watch TV shows (which are 44 minuet long shows).  And the time just FLY'S by when you do it this way.  In a way it's almost fun.  The on-board meter that comes with the machine does its job pretty well.  It has the most simplest features, but these features to me are crucial.  Calorie count, time, speed, and distance.  The machine cycles through these every few seconds.  And for me has worked out very well. It has a auto-stop feature that stops the clock if you stop cycling (and starts back up when you start cycling again), which is nice to have.  It is also easily reset by holding down the main red button for a few seconds.  The only complaint I would have about the meter is sometimes it's hard to read, It would be nice to have a back-light of some kind or perhaps colored LED letters/numbers (like a digital clock).<br /><br />Now finding the right position for the machine in relation to your chair/legs can be quite tricky.  I suggest you mark the floor with the spots you are comfortable with (I use tape to mark the end points).  That way when you use it again you will have it in the same exact spot as before.  And trust me, this makes a bigger difference than you might imagine.  As this is one of the biggest drawbacks of the portable machine like this, is the inconstancy with placement.  Cause the full sized machines are always fixed.  So if you mark the floor and keep it in the same spot each time, this will make it much better.  The other part about this machine is that it does move, especially when you start to speed up.  I have tried a few different things to keep it from moving, putting weights on the end, but this didn't help much and it slowly creeps forward as you use it.  I now have a bar that hits the end of the machine legs and is placed against a non-moving platform.  So far this is working great for me.  But make sure you do something like this, because if the machine slowly moves forward, it can get quite annoying and changes the dynamics of the exercise more than you might think.<br /><br />Another thing to note about this machine is that the outer plastic casing does warm up (not hot, just warm).  I am not sure why it would warm up, cause if it was 100% magnetic based, there shouldn't be any touching/rubbing parts on the inside.  But perhaps the heat comes from some kind of magnetic energy field that gets generated when using this.  But either way the warmth isn't a problem at all, just thought I would mention it.<br /><br />Overall it is working out great for me.  I am not sure how long it will last, but so far with almost 25 hours of constant use, it is holding up nicely.<br /><br />P.S. Oh and I use this machine with my bear feet.  Never tried using it with shoes yet.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well, it's been just about 3 months now since I received this product.  I am proud to say I have been using it for at least 45 minuets a day since I got the machine... I have not missed ONE day of exercise since I got it, no kidding.  Mixed with a calorie reduced diet and 45 minuet pedal exercise each day, I am steadily losing weight, feeling better and looking thinner.<br /><br />There is only a few things I want to point out.  First isn't so much about the machine, but about technique.  After using this machine daily, you really start to work your way up in speed.  I can now hold steady at 24-25 MPH for 45 mins straight.  This ends up burning roughly 670 calories according to the bike.  And believe me, even after all this time of me using the machine, I still get one heck of a burn.  I have never sweat so much in my life (seriously).  This may sound gross, but after I am done with my 45 mins on the machine, my t-shirt is literally dripping with sweat.  My entire shirt from head to waste is absolutely soaked (especially my backside).  And I have to make sure I have a heavy duty sweat rag to wipe my face and neck every minuet or so.  So yeah, the machine does work just as well as a stand-alone machine IMO.<br /><br />Secondly is the downsides I have found so far.  For the most part, the machine still works flawlessly.  It is still very smooth and the resistance stays the same day in and day out.  However, it does make a lot of creaking and cracking noises when I use it.  At one point it was making a very loud horrible screeching sound every time I rotation around.  So I took the outer-shell off as best I could (without unscrewing the pedals) and once I put it back together the sound went away.  But is still creaks, cracks and pops with every turn, and can get very annoying if you let it get to you (it's the sound of the outer-shell plastic moving against itself).  If tedious popping and creaking sounds annoy you (they do for me, I also hate constant barking dogs), one thing you can do is put on a movie or TV show and crank the volume up while you use the machine.  Another solution would be to completely remove the outer plastic shell around the machine.  I would do this, but my pedals seems to be permanently stuck in place now, so I cannot remove them and therefore cannot remove the shell.  But aside from looking a bit odd (neat inner workings though) this should get rid of the creaking noises.  And far as I can tell from when I unscrewed the shell, it does nothing except add cosmetic features to the machine and make creaking noises.<br /><br />But the overall operation of the machine is still is in good working condition.  Aside from the annoying popping/cracking noises that make it anything but quiet, it works great and provides a excellent exercise.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/19/2011:  Well, this is just a minor update to comment on the bikes long-term use.  As mentioned previously in my last update, I had commented that the machine makes constant creaking and cracking noises as you use it, and can drive somebody absolutely insane if your a person who gets overly irritated at random noises that are completely out of your control.  Well, after repeatedly performing some make-shift surgury to the bike to finally pin-point the problem, I have completely eliminated the creaking noises by lining the entire inside of the machines shell (where the plastic meets itself) with thick tape and screwed it down nice and tight.  The creaking noises are now completely GONE!<br /><br />However while I always manage to fix something, another problem rolls right around the corner.  So after fixing the plastic creaking FINALLY, now I am having trouble with my pedals.  Aside from the horrible squeaking as I rotated the pedals (they just needed some oil) they are now getting more and more loose(side to side and up/down looseness).  So this in turn often creates a strange 'lumpy' feeling on each rotation when I am using it, and can often make thumping noises too.  The good thing is that this bike seems to have the same pedal threading and size as a regular bicycle pedal (and every other exercise bike pedal as well) so I think I can easily replace the pedals with different ones for less than $15.  And once I do that, it should be smooth sailing!<br /><br />Overall though, the internals are still working absolutely perfectly with no flaws that I can see yet, even after 45 mins a day for just about 4 months now (I still haven't missed one day yet).  I am simply amazed at the quality of the construction for the moving internal parts.  The pedals may suck, and the case may need fixing to avoid creaking and is cheap plastic... but the insides are built like a tank!<br /><br />UPDATE 5/26/11 - Well, still not ONE day has passed where I did not exercise at least 45 minuets on this pedal exerciser.  Since my last update there hasn't been any major problems that have arose.  There have been some minor technical problems with the pedals, but after completely dissembling my pedals and re-oiling them, it has been fairly smooth sailing.  Sure the pedals still click and 'thump' under certain circumstances, but they are holding up quite well.<br /><br />Recently I tried switching the stock pedals with some non-stock pedals I got from here on Amazon, but the new pedals I got were worse then the stock ones.  Only a few minuets into my exercise and my new pedals started thumping horribly, which was unbelievably annoying. I have since replaced the new pedals with the stock ones after a full disassembly and re-oiling.<br /><br />In case anybody is wondering, the stock pedals for this machine are 9/16"", and they have no bearings whatsoever.",positive,1,2010-11-03,Health & Personal Care

My traditional lense cleaner has not been doing a good job so I decided to gjve this another try.<br /><br />My results this time are back to 5-Stars<br />1). Follow the directions on the box, wash hands, fill container to line with solution; put lenses in case, rinse lenses in case with stream of solution, put lenses in case.<br />2). Let soak at least 6-hours.<br />3). Open container, dump solution and rinse lenses with Saline solution while still in case. 4). Remove lenses from case and rinse inside with a tad more saline solution.<br /><br />This last step will ensure that if the platinum on your case is losing its effectiveness or if you did not leave them the full 6-hours that you will not experience a burn.<br /><br />I believe my traditional saline solution was close to expiration, but using the Clear Care in the above manner is far superior to standard overnight contact cleaners.<br /><br />Update - July 5, 2020. I have decided that traditional lens cleaner works better. I wear 30 day lenses and have done several tests one month, typical BL lens overnight cleanser. At the lens change I did an entire month with Clear Care.<br /><br />At the 30 day mark with standard cleaner my lenses felt good, in fact, so good that I can wear them another 10 days or 2-weeks.<br /><br />With the Clear Care being used 100%, at about day 20 my lenses felt like they needed to be changed.  I will use it every other day until its gone, but will not repurchase it.<br /><br />I want to add that my result my not be what everyone experiences. I tend to deposit a lot of proteins on my lenses. You may not, and you proteins may be more easily broken down by clear care.<br /><br />Initial product review below.<br /><br />I really like this product HOWEVER you must be careful that the platinum disk is still generating the chemical reaction.  Usually, one case will work for one bottle and then the case should be disposed of.  I am about halfway through a bottle and noticed that my disk seemed to not be generating quite the reaction that it did early on.

Shakes with milk taste better.<br /><br />The price is $30 as I write this, which seems too high for what it is.<br /><br />This product says “keto friendly,” but that is untrue. This is mostly carbs and protein. One of the main ingredients is maltodextrin. This drink will likely kick you out of ketosis and spike your insulin. While the carbohydrate count is under the threshold for ketosis, I would not drink this if you hope to be on a keto diet. To advertise “no sugar added,” then add in maltodextrin as the substitute is misleading, since it has the same negative effects as sugar.<br /><br />While I am not in the lactose-free target audience, I am in the keto diet target audience. For the target audience that I am in, this is a bad meal replacement.",negative,1,2021-04-03,Health & Personal Care

I firstly like is the true value, time, with benefits these 3 little partners have been and still are in exercising facial muscles in stimulating increased blood flow and collagen with all together does more than you think to all the layers, cells of the skin, underneath the skin it’s in the making of rejuvenating all substances that keep your face looking refreshed, younger, and decreasing wrinkles/lines in tightening the skin because just like I workout my whole overall body muscles (try to) why not facial muscles too, cause they also have a big difference in body appearance. Last but not least, it works out your lymphatic system in detoxification! WOW! What more can a woman/man ask for in just a few min a day while watching TV or whatever. I use 2 at a time doing same sequence, pattern, etc. using 1 on each side of face, the “double header face treatment” I call it. It’s way cheaper than other facial vibration devices these days and it’s fun relaxing and refreshing! Oh! the 3rd one is for emergencies if one’s out of battery.

B079V16XZP,"The most comfortable ear plugs I've worn! I've been going to concerts regularly for around 15 years and in the past, I've either gone without ear protection (don't do that) or worn single-use foam ear plugs.  I knew I was going to be attending 4 or 5 concerts within the span of a couple of months, so I purchased a pair of Loop ear plugs and I'm happy to report they worked great!  They do a really excellent job of reducing the intensity of amplified sound in such a way that you can still hear it but it doesn't hurt or leave a ringing in your ears.  The foam ear tips fit really well and the loops stay in my ears even while bouncing around (the first time I wore them there was some slight discomfort but the next concert I could barely even feel that they were in).  My one complaint is that it almost completely shuts out non-amplified audio, so the crowds singing along at the concerts are barely audible, leaving me with the weird feeling like I'm the only one singing along... but it's so much better than disposable foam ear plugs, it's worth the slight drawback.  Bonus: the little carrying pouch is a nice feature, and I like that there are several color options so my wife and I could pick different ones and not get them mixed up.",positive,1,2020-03-09,Health & Personal Care
